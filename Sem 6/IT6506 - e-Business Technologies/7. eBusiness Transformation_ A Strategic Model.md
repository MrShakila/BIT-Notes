# eBusiness Transformation: A Strategic Model

## Introduction to eTransformation and its Differences from BPR

### Defining eTransformation and Business Process Reengineering (BPR)

- eTransformation involves adopting and integrating digital technologies across various organizational aspects, driving digital innovation, enhancing customer experiences, and transforming business models.

- BPR focuses on radically redesigning existing business processes to improve efficiency, effectiveness, and quality, often involving rethinking and restructuring workflows or departments.

### Contrasting Approaches of eTransformation and BPR

- eTransformation is iterative and adaptable, building upon existing processes incrementally and integrating new digital solutions into existing infrastructure.  BPR follows a "clean slate" approach, analyzing and reimagining processes from scratch.

- Technology is central to eTransformation, involving strategic selection and integration of digital technologies. In BPR, technology is a supporting enabler, not the primary driver.

- Change management in eTransformation extends beyond process redesign, encompassing cultural and organizational changes. In BPR, change management addresses employee concerns related to process redesign.

## Initiating eTransformation and Key Aspects

### Starting the eTransformation Process

- Prioritizing understanding core business priorities before focusing on e-business priorities is crucial.  The "e" in e-business is temporary; the ultimate goal is improved business processes.

### Important Aspects of eTransformation

- A holistic approach to business transformation is necessary.

- Understanding the business and IT environment, including internal (B2E) and external (B2C, B2B) readiness, is vital.

- Defining business goals and strategies, identifying strategic partnerships, and calculating ROI are essential.

- Addressing ICT infrastructure issues, security, maintenance, disaster recovery, and change management are crucial.

- A process-based, rather than project-based, approach should be adopted, with KPIs used to evaluate performance.

## The Seven E's Model for eTransformation

### Overview of the Seven E's Model

- This model provides a strategic framework for eTransformation, encompassing seven key stages: Environmental Analysis, eBusiness Goals/Strategies, eReadiness (Internal/External), eTransformation Roadmap, eTransformation Methodology, eSystems (ICT/Business Maintenance), and Evolution-Change Management.  Each stage builds upon the previous one.

### Detailed Explanation of Each Stage within the Seven E's Model

- Environmental Analysis:  Involves analyzing global IT/business trends, conducting SWOT and industry analyses (Porter's Five Forces).

- eBusiness Goals/Strategies: Defining corporate strategy/goals considering strategic factors, choosing a strategic positioning (Cost Focus, Cost Leadership, Differentiation Focus, Differentiation) based on organizational status (Survival, Sustainability, or Growth).

- eReadiness (Internal/External): Assessing the organization's readiness for eTransformation, considering business processes, applications & infrastructure, web presence, skills, executive management, external connectivity, and future directions.  External readiness includes assessing customers, suppliers, and potential users.

- eTransformation Roadmap:  Provides a clear path for the organization, assessing its current status and outlining the direction to proceed.  The University of Western Sydney's roadmap is used as a guideline.

- eTransformation Methodology: An iterative, evolutionary process enabling the enterprise to adapt to change more effectively.  Internal methodology focuses on change management, business process modeling, and re-engineering. External methodology focuses on online/offline promotion, identifying information requirements, management and maintenance, and design and development.

- eSystems (ICT/Business Maintenance):  Focuses on establishing an integrated business and IT system, implementing IT policies, and ensuring support systems for long-term sustainability.  This includes management controls, security measures, and IT maintenance and support.

- Evolution-Change Management:  Addresses internal changes using the 7S model (Strategy, Structure, Systems, Shared Values, Style, Staff, Skills), linking all stages and implementing strategic, managerial, and operational changes.

## eBusiness Models and the Extended Enterprise

### Various eBusiness Models

- The document describes several eBusiness models: Direct-to-Customer, Supply Chain, Full-Service Provider, and Revenue Sharing.  Each model is illustrated with diagrams showing the flow of products and money.

### The Extended Enterprise and Collaboration

- The extended enterprise model emphasizes collaboration among T1 and T2 suppliers, manufacturing, and customers to achieve success.  This involves addressing design and project management issues.

## Conclusion: Agility and Adaptability in eBusiness Transformation

### Agility and adaptability are key to successful eBusiness transformation. Organizations must embrace continuous improvement, iterate, and adjust strategies based on feedback and market trends.  A holistic approach encompassing strategic vision, effective leadership, stakeholder engagement, data-driven decision-making, and adaptability is crucial for achieving improved operational efficiency, enhanced customer experiences, and sustainable growth.
