# IT6506 - e-Business Technologies: Evolution of eMarketplaces

## Evolution of eMarketplaces

### Early Stages of eMarketplaces

- Initial eMarketplaces were basic online platforms connecting buyers and sellers of goods and services.

- Examples include eBay and Amazon, both launched in the mid-1990s.

### Expansion and Specialization

- As popularity grew, more companies launched their own online marketplaces.

- Some focused on specific niches (e.g., Etsy for handmade goods, Airbnb for lodging), while others remained general.

### Mobile Revolution and B2B Expansion

- The rise of mobile devices led to mobile-first eMarketplaces (e.g., Uber, PickMe).

- Digital transformation created B2B eMarketplaces (e.g., Alibaba, ThomasNet) enabling online business-to-business transactions.

### Platformization and Decentralization

- Some eMarketplaces evolved into full-fledged platforms offering services beyond buying and selling (e.g., Amazon's expansion into streaming and cloud computing).

- Blockchain technology facilitated the creation of decentralized eMarketplaces (e.g., OpenBazaar, Bitify) operating without central authority.

## Traditional vs. New Business Models

### Key Differences in Business Models

- Production: Shifted from mass production to personalized (e.g., Dell's build-to-order model).

- Distribution: Transitioned from middleman-based to direct (e.g., Dell's direct sales).

- Communication: Changed from chained/closed to networked/open systems.

- Finance: Moved from slow and difficult to faster and easier (24/7) transactions.

- Markets: Expanded from local/geographical to global, transcending boundaries.

- Assets: Transformed from tangible/physical to intangible/virtual assets.

### Traditional Business Model Analysis

- Traditional models are analyzed using Michael Porter's Five Forces: bargaining power of suppliers, bargaining power of buyers, threat of new entrants, threat of substitutes, and rivalry among competitors.

### New Business Model Strategies

- Strategies to mitigate the five forces include: product differentiation, strategic alliances, product bundling, customer relationship management (CRM), cost leadership, and backward/forward integration.

## Direct-to-Customer Interaction

### Stages of Customer Interaction

- Awareness: Educating customers about products/services.

- Consideration: Guiding prospects through the sales funnel.

- Conversion: Turning prospects into customers.

- Retention: Gathering feedback to improve customer satisfaction.

- Advocacy: Encouraging customer loyalty and referrals.

### Direct-to-Customer Interaction Defined

## Mass Customization

### Mass Customization Defined

- Mass customization combines mass production and customization to create products tailored to individual needs and preferences while maintaining economies of scale.

### Benefits of Mass Customization

- Reduced waste by avoiding overproduction.

- Competitive advantage through unique, personalized offerings.

### Challenges of Mass Customization

- Difficulty in forecasting sales due to diverse options.

- Challenges in planning for surges in demand.

- Impacts on supply chain flow with third-party partners.

- Increased wait times from order to shipment.

- Higher costs to maintain diverse production machinery.

## Virtual Organizations

### Virtual Organizations Defined

- Virtual organizations are networks of geographically dispersed individuals or groups collaborating through technology to achieve common goals.

- They can be project-based or ongoing, spanning multiple locations and time zones.

### Benefits of Virtual Organizations

- Access to a wider talent pool.

- Reduced overhead costs.

- Increased flexibility for members.

- Enhanced collaboration through technology.

- Reduced environmental impact.

### Challenges of Virtual Organizations

- Concerns about trust, convenience, and security.

## Final Goal and Broader Considerations

### The Ultimate Goal of eBusiness

- The ultimate goal is seamless connectivity, information access, business conduct, and service delivery to anyone, anytime, anywhere, securely, easily, cost-effectively, and with a single click.

### Ethical Considerations

- The presentation concludes with a reflection on the importance of addressing human needs (poverty, education, health, peace, inequality) alongside business goals, questioning whether technology is being used to its full potential for societal good.
