# eBusiness Applications and Success Stories

## Ride-Hailing Apps

### Uber

- Uber's origin stems from the founders' inability to find a ride in Paris in 2008.

- The first Uber ride was requested on July 5, 2010.

- Uber launched in Sri Lanka in January 2015 and expanded into food delivery in April 2015.

- The app allows users to sign up via web or mobile app using phone numbers, Google, Facebook, or Apple accounts.

- Users input their destination, view available options and prices, and confirm their preferred choice.

- Uber assigns a driver, and the user can track the driver's location in real-time.

- After pickup confirmation, the route is displayed for the user.

- Users can add tips, view driver details, share trip status, and rate the driver after the trip.

- Uber's value proposition for passengers includes lower wait times, lower prices, ease of access, and safety.

- For drivers, Uber offers flexible working hours, extra income, ride selection, and access to a large passenger pool.

- Uber's costs include infrastructure and employee salaries.

- Revenues are generated through commissions from rides, surge pricing, and premium rides.

- Surge pricing uses an algorithm to balance supply and demand by applying a multiplier to the standard fare.

- A case study of a concert at Madison Square Garden showed surge pricing effectively increased driver supply and reduced wait times while some customers opted for alternative transportation.

- A New Year's Eve 2014-2015 case study in New York City demonstrated that the absence of surge pricing led to a significant increase in wait times and a drop in the completion rate due to insufficient drivers.

- Time savings due to reduced commuting time and flexible learning schedules.

- Wide selection of programs due to location and schedule independence.

### Issues with Online Learning

## Moodle

### Moodle is a learning platform providing a single, secure, and integrated system for personalized learning environments.

### It's a free and open-source Learning Management System used by schools, universities, and other institutions for blended and online learning.

### Moodle's founder, Martin Dougiamas, was inspired by his experience delivering education via shortwave radio in a remote area.

### Moodle 1.0 was released in August 2002.

### The first official Moodle MOOC launched in September 2013.

### Demand for online learning management systems increased significantly in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Zoom

### Zoom is a cloud-based video conferencing platform used for meetings and webinars.

### Features include video conferencing, screen sharing, meeting recordings, breakout rooms, password-protected meetings, end-to-end encryption, user authentication, waiting rooms, and participant removal.

### Zoom's success is attributed to fortunate timing (the pandemic), low data usage (allowing use with slower internet), ease of use, and cost-effectiveness.
