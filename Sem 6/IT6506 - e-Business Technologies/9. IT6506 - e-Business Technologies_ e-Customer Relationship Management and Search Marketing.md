### Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

- SEO is a structured approach to improving a company's or product's position in search engine results.

- It involves controlling index inclusion and optimizing various factors that influence ranking.

- Key factors include keyword density, number of inbound links, title HTML tag, meta-tags, and alternative graphic text.

### SEO Factors

- Keyword density: The number of times a key phrase is repeated in webpage text.  Overuse (keyword stuffing) can negatively impact ranking.

- Number of inbound links: More links from high-quality sites improve ranking. Google's PageRank algorithm considers each link as a vote, weighting links from high-ranking pages more heavily.

- Title HTML tag: Keywords in the title tag increase the likelihood of higher ranking.  Keyphrases positioned towards the left of the title tag and those with higher keyphrase density receive greater weighting.

- Meta-tags: Snippets of code embedded in HTML source files.  While Google no longer assigns relevance to meta-tags, other search engines may still consider them.

- Alternative graphic text (ALT tags):  Associating hidden text with graphical images for search engine indexing.  While less relevant now, ALT tags are still important for accessibility.
