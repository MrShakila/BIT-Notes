- Technology is vital for managing relationships and information flow.

- Effective SCM optimizes information, product, and cash flow.

### The Evolution of SCM

- The Creation Era saw the emergence of SCM concepts with assembly lines and large-scale changes.

- The Integration Era involved the development of EDI and ERP systems, leading to increased value-added and cost reduction through integration.

- The Globalization Era extended supply chains beyond national boundaries.

- The Specialization Era (Phase I & II) focused on core competencies, outsourcing, and the rise of specialized supply chain solutions.

- SCM 2.0 leverages Web 2.0 principles, emphasizing collaboration, information sharing, and adaptability to rapid changes.
