# Native Application Development with Android

## Course Overview and Learning Outcomes

### Course Introduction

- This course introduces native application development using Java.  It covers setting up the development environment and building a first application. Students will learn to create user interfaces, manage data, and integrate with web services.  By the end, students will have a solid foundation in native application development with Java and be able to create their own Android applications.

### Intended Learning Outcomes

- After completing this section, students will be able to:

- Demonstrate understanding of the Java language and its syntax.

- Develop and deploy native mobile applications for Android or iOS platforms using Java.

- Apply object-oriented programming principles to develop modular, maintainable, and extensible applications using Java.

- Analyse and debug code using debugging tools and techniques and optimize application performance.

## Android Fundamentals

### What is Android?

- Android is a mobile operating system based on the Linux kernel. It's used on over 80% of smartphones and powers devices like watches, TVs, and cars.  The Google Play store hosts over 2 million Android apps.  It's highly customizable and open source.

### Android User Interaction and Sensors

- Android supports touch gestures (swiping, tapping, pinching), a virtual keyboard, and Bluetooth/USB peripherals.  Sensors detect user actions and respond accordingly (e.g., rotating device content, adjusting map position based on walking, tilting to steer a virtual car).

### Android Software Development Kit (SDK) and Publishing

- The Android SDK provides development tools (debugger, monitors, editors), libraries, virtual devices (emulators), documentation, and sample code.  Applications are published through the Google Play store, Google's official app store for Android.

## Android Architecture and App Development

### Android Platform Architecture

- The Android platform architecture consists of:

- System and user apps

- Java API framework (Android OS API in Java)

- Native C/C++ libraries and Android runtime

- Hardware abstraction layer (HAL)

- Linux kernel

### What is an Android App?

- An Android app consists of one or more interactive screens. It's written using Java and XML, utilizes the Android SDK, Android libraries, and the Android Application Framework.  It's executed by the Android Runtime virtual machine (ART).

### Challenges of Android Development

- Challenges include handling multiple screen sizes and resolutions, ensuring app performance and security, maintaining compatibility with older platform versions, and effective marketing.

## Setting up the Development Environment and Building an App

### Setting up the Tools and Environment: Android Studio

- Android Studio is the official IDE for Android app development.  Features include a flexible Gradle-based build system, a fast and feature-rich emulator, Apply Changes functionality, code templates and GitHub integration, extensive testing tools, and lint tools.  It supports C++ and the NDK.

### Android Studio Installation

- Android Studio can be installed on Mac, Windows, or Linux. Download it from https://developer.android.com/studio/.  The installation process includes setting up a virtual device and creating a "Hello World" application.

### Project Structure and Gradle Build System

- Android projects contain:

- manifest: AndroidManifest.xml (app description)

- java: Java source code

- res: Resources (XML, layouts, strings, images)

- build.gradle: Gradle build files

- The Gradle build system is a modern build subsystem in Android Studio, managing project, module, and settings files.  Detailed low-level Gradle knowledge isn't typically necessary. More information is available at https://gradle.org/. Running the app involves selecting a virtual or physical device.  For physical devices, developer options and USB debugging must be enabled.

## User Interfaces, Activities, and Fragments

### App Manifest and Resources: AndroidManifest.xml

- AndroidManifest.xml contains essential information about the app.  It declares:

- App components (activities, services, broadcast receivers, content providers)

- Permissions needed

- Hardware and software features required

- Each app component requires a corresponding XML element in the manifest file (e.g.,  <activity> ,  <service> ,  <receiver> ,  <provider> ).  The manifest also specifies icons and labels for app components and intent filters.  Permissions are required to access sensitive user data or system features.  Device compatibility is also declared in the manifest, specifying hardware and software features required.

### Activities and Fragments

- An activity is a single, focused thing the user can do.  Activities use  setContentView()  to place UI elements within a window.  Key lifecycle methods include  onCreate()  (initialization) and  onPause()  (handling user pausing).  Fragments within the  FragmentActivity  subclass modularize code, build sophisticated interfaces, and help scale applications across different screen sizes.

### Layouts, Adapters, Action Bar, Dialogs, and Notifications

- Views are basic UI building blocks.  View subclasses include  TextView ,  EditText ,  Button ,  ScrollView ,  RecyclerView , and  ImageView .  They are defined in XML and Java code.  Layouts (e.g.,  ConstraintLayout ,  LinearLayout ,  RelativeLayout ,  GridLayout ,  TableLayout ,  FrameLayout ) arrange views.  Adapters help incompatible interfaces work together (e.g., preparing data from a database for a View).  The ActionBar is a primary toolbar.  Dialogs prompt users for decisions or information.  Notifications display messages outside the regular app UI.

## Data and App Interaction

### Intents and Broadcast Receivers

- An Intent describes an operation.  It's an object requesting action from another app component via the Android system.  Intents can start activities, start services, or deliver broadcasts.  They can be explicit (specifying the target component) or implicit (asking the system to find a suitable component).

### Preferences and Saving

- SharedPreferences stores small amounts of primitive data as key/value pairs.  The  SharedPreference  class provides APIs for reading, writing, and managing this data. Data is saved in  onPause()  and restored in  onCreate() .  SharedPreferences persists data across user sessions, while the saved instance state preserves data across activity instances within a session.

### Content Providers and Services

- Content providers manage access to data, allowing data sharing between apps.  They encapsulate data and provide data security.  A service is an application component performing long-running background operations without a user interface.  Services are good for network transactions, playing music, file I/O, and database interaction.  They can be started or bound.  Foreground services run in the background but require user awareness.

## Asynchronous Tasks and AsyncTaskLoader

### Threads

- The main thread executes code line by line.  It's crucial for UI updates and responsiveness.  Long-running tasks should be offloaded to background threads to prevent UI freezes or ANR (Application Not Responding) dialogs.

### AsyncTask

- AsyncTask implements basic background tasks.   doInBackground()  runs on a background thread, while  onPostExecute()  processes results on the main thread.  Helper methods include  onPreExecute()  and  onProgressUpdate() .  AsyncTask is suitable for short or interruptible tasks with lower priority.

### AsyncTaskLoader

- AsyncTaskLoader provides asynchronous data loading, reconnecting to the Activity after configuration changes.  It handles LoaderManager and efficiently manages configuration changes.  It's preferred for tasks that can be left unfinished or require higher priority than AsyncTask.

## Sensors and Communication

### Sensors (Sensor Identification and Registration)

- Most Android devices have built-in sensors measuring motion, orientation, and environmental conditions.  Sensor categories include motion sensors (accelerometers, gyroscopes), environmental sensors (barometers, photometers), and position sensors (magnetometers).  Sensor availability varies across devices and Android versions.  The Android sensor framework provides a SensorManager for accessing and listening to sensors.

### Orientation and Movement

- The geomagnetic field sensor and accelerometer determine device position.  The system computes orientation angles (azimuth, pitch, roll) relative to the earth's frame of reference.

### Sending and Receiving SMS

- Android telephony APIs access the underlying telephone hardware stack.  Due to security concerns, creating an "in call" Activity is not allowed.  The Telephony.Sms.Inbox class accesses text-based SMS messages.
