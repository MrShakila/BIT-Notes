# Mobile Application Development Platforms: Android and iOS

## Mobile Operating Systems

### Overview of Mobile OS Platforms

- The presentation focuses on Android and iOS, the two dominant mobile application development platforms.

- It will discuss the architectures of both, with a stronger emphasis on Android.

- The presentation will also cover factors to consider when selecting a platform for mobile application development.

### Different Mobile OS Platforms

- Several mobile operating systems exist, including Android (Google), iOS (Apple), Bada (Samsung), BlackBerry OS (Research in Motion), Windows OS (Microsoft), Symbian OS (Nokia), and Tizen (Samsung).

- Android is the most popular, based on the Linux kernel and open-source software.

- iOS, developed by Apple, is known for its security.  Other platforms like Bada, Blackberry OS, and Symbian OS have seen less market success.

### Market Share of Mobile OS Platforms (2009-2022)

- A graph shows the market share of various mobile OS platforms from 2009 to 2022.

- Android, iOS, and Windows became the leading platforms over time.

- Other platforms like Symbian, Blackberry OS, and Windows Phone experienced significant declines in market share.

## Android Development Platform

### Android Open Source Project (AOSP)

- The Android Open Source Project (AOSP) provides publicly available and modifiable Android source code.

- Anyone can download and modify AOSP for their devices.

- AOSP offers a complete and fully functional implementation of the Android mobile platform.  There are two levels of compatibility for devices using AOSP: AOSP compatibility and Android compatibility.

### Android Open System Platform Architecture

- The AOSP software stack has several layers: Android app layer, privileged app layer, device manufacturer app layer, System API, Android API, Android Framework, System Services, Android Runtime (ART), Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL), Native Daemons and Libraries, and Linux Kernel.

- The Android API is used to create apps, which can be uploaded to and downloaded from the Google Play Store.

- Privileged apps use a combination of Android and system APIs and must be preinstalled.

### Android Platform Components

- Android is an open-source, Linux-based software stack supporting various devices and form factors.

- The Android software stack includes the Linux kernel, Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL), Android Runtime (ART), native C/C++ libraries, Java API framework, and system apps.

- The Linux kernel forms the foundation, providing core functionalities.  The HAL provides a standard interface for hardware access. ART handles app execution, and the Java API framework provides tools for app development.

## iOS Development Platform

### Overview of iOS

- iOS is Apple's proprietary mobile operating system.

- It supports Objective-C, C, C++, and Swift programming languages.

- It's based on macOS and is the world's second most popular mobile operating system, known for its user-centric design.

### iOS Version History

- The iPhone was first released in June 2007.

- In June 2010, Apple rebranded iPhone OS as iOS.

- A table lists the various iOS versions and their release dates.

### iOS Layered Architecture

- iOS has a layered architecture consisting of Core OS, Core Services, Media Layer, and Cocoa Touch.

- The Core OS layer includes frameworks for Bluetooth, acceleration, external accessories, security, and local authentication.

- The Core Services layer provides frameworks for address book, CloudKit, Core Data, Core Foundation, Core Location, Core Motion, HealthKit, HomeKit, Social, and StoreKit.

### iOS Media Layer

- The Media Layer includes UIKit Graphics, Core Graphics, Core Animation, Core Images, OpenGL ES and GLKit, Metal, Audio Framework (Media Player, AV Foundation, OpenAL), and Video Framework (AVKit, AV Foundation, Core Media).

- This layer handles graphics rendering, animation, image and video processing, and audio playback.

### iOS Cocoa Touch Layer

- The Cocoa Touch layer includes EventKit, GameKit, iAd, MapKit, PushKit, Twitter, and UIKit frameworks.

- This layer provides user interface elements and integration with system services.

## Selecting a Mobile Application Development Platform

### Factors to Consider When Choosing a Platform

- Selecting the right platform is crucial for the success of a mobile application.

- Key factors include:

	- Target audience: Researching the target audience's device preferences and interests.

	- Development cost:  Proper cost estimation is necessary, as costs vary significantly between platforms.

	- Device support:  Consider how many devices the application should support (iOS supports a limited number).

	- Application business model: Defining the application's purpose, monetization strategy, and user relationship.

	- Technical features: Assessing the ease of implementing required technical features and ensuring platform compatibility.

	- Third-party integrations:  Choosing a platform that simplifies confidential integration with third-party software.
