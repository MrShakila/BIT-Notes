- Included games like Snake.

- Introduced a variety of applications and services.

- GSM network providers added GPRS, enabling packet-switched data services (2.5G).

- Example: Motorola RAZR.

### The Smartphone Era (2002-Present)

- Distinguished by a common operating system, larger screen size, QWERTY keyboard or stylus, and high-speed wireless connectivity.

- SymbianOS was a popular operating system developed by Nokia, Motorola, Ericsson, and Psion.

- Examples: Nokia S60, 6260, and N95.  Early smartphones also came from companies like Palm, Handspring, and RIM.

### The Touch Era (Present)

- Represents a completely new medium for interacting with information.

- Integrates numerous technological advancements rapidly.

- Connects to advanced networks like 4G and 5G.

- Utilizes apps for a multitude of tasks, including location tracking, advanced video capturing, improved image quality, sensor integration, and improved data communication.

## The Mobile Ecosystem

### Understanding the Mobile Ecosystem

- The mobile ecosystem is a unique system, similar to the internet, composed of many interconnected parts.

- This section explores the components and their interactions.

- The underlying complexity is usually hidden from the user.

- It's important to understand these layers to appreciate the user experience.

### Layers of the Mobile Ecosystem

- The ecosystem is structured in layers: Operators, Networks, Devices, Platforms, Operating Systems, Application Frameworks, Applications, and Services.

### Operators

- The base layer of the mobile ecosystem.

- Also known as Mobile Network Operators (MNOs), mobile service providers, wireless carriers, or cellular companies.

- Responsible for creating and maintaining a reliable cellular network.

- Activities include installing cellular towers, operating the network, providing services (like internet access), maintaining subscriber relationships, handling billing and support, and offering subsidized device sales.

### Networks

- Operated by mobile network operators.

- Network capabilities are determined by the type of radio and antenna.

- While core voice communication technology remains relatively consistent, network generations (2G, 3G, 4G, etc.) are used to describe data speeds.

- Generations help track advancements in the mobile network domain.

### 1G Networks

- First-generation mobile technology was entirely analog.

- Japan's NTT launched the first automatic cellular network in 1989.

- Key features: analog technology, circuit-switched networks for voice calls only.

- Key issues: low voice quality, large phone size due to power requirements, security risks, frequent call drops, and limited network capacity.

### 2G Networks

- Similar structure to 1G networks but introduced digital technology.

- Introduced Caller ID and SMS.

- Standards include GSM, GPRS, EDGE, and HSCSD.

- Key features: SMS, MMS, internet access, camera phones, and higher data rates than 1G.

- Issues: weak signal in sparsely populated areas, slow internet speeds.

### 3G Networks

- The mobile telephone system used in modern times.

- Supports many more applications than previous generations.

- Standards include W-CDMA, UMTS, UMTSTDD, TD-CDMA, HSPA, HSDPA, and HSUPA.

- Key features: global roaming, larger email exchange, easy web browsing, GPS, video calls, high-resolution TV, and online multiplayer games.

- Issues: expensive to build and use.

### 4G Networks

- A significant advancement over 3G, primarily in speed.

- Based on existing 2G and 3G technologies with improvements.

- Most mobile models released from 2013 onwards support 4G.

- User experience includes less buffering, higher voice quality, easy access to instant messaging and social media, quality streaming, and faster download speeds.

### Devices

- Any instrument that can communicate or connect to a network.

- Capabilities depend on the connection network and inbuilt support for various networks.

- Connectivity plays a major role in successful communication.

### Platforms

- Provide access to devices.

- Needed to run software and services on devices.

- Essentially a core programming language.

- Categorized as licensed, proprietary, or open source.

### Examples of Platforms

- Licensed: Java ME, BREW, Windows Mobile, LiMo.

- Proprietary: Palm, BlackBerry (Java-based), iPhone (proprietary version of Mac OS X).

- Open source: Android.

### Operating Systems

- Often have core services or toolkits enabling applications to communicate and share data.

- Examples: Symbian, Windows Mobile, Palm OS, Linux, Mac OS X, Android.

### Application Frameworks

- Run on top of operating systems, sharing core services like communications, messaging, graphics, location, security, and authentication.

- Examples: Java ME, Windows Mobile Win32 API, Android SDK, and the Web (cross-platform).

### Applications

- Created using application frameworks.

- Examples: games, web browsers, cameras, media players.

- Maintaining stability across multiple devices is challenging for developers.

- Cross-platform app development frameworks are emerging to address this issue.

### Services

- Include tasks like accessing the internet, sending text messages, and getting location information.

- Essentially anything the user is trying to do.

- Important due to mobile device resource constraints.

- Allow users to offload processing to servers.

## Developing a Mobile Strategy

### Rules for Developing a Mobile Strategy

- This section outlines rules to follow when creating a mobile strategy.

### Rule #1: Forget What You Think You Know

- Forget existing knowledge about mobile technology.

- Start by asking fundamental questions about your business, users, and development capacity, independent of current trends.

### Rule #2: Believe What You See, Not What You Read

- Avoid outdated documentation.

- Talk to users to understand real-world usage.

### Rule #3: Constraints Never Come First

- Start with big ideas, avoiding letting constraints limit the project early on.

### Rule #4: Focus on Context, Goals, and Needs

- Define user context and goals.

- Understand how context affects goals.

- Identify user tasks.

- Filter content by context (location, media, model).

### Rule #5: You Cannot Support Everything

- Focus on devices representing your core customer.

- The most popular or easiest device may not be the best choice.

- Check server logs to identify frequently used devices.

- Conduct market research to determine target customer devices.

### Rule #6: Do Not Convert, Create

- Understand user context and access patterns.

- Recognize mobile's unique characteristics.

- Avoid simply adapting web or print strategies.

### Rule #7: Keep It Simple

- Limit features to those crucial for users.

- Prioritize user interests over corporate goals.

- Focus on user needs to drive interaction.
