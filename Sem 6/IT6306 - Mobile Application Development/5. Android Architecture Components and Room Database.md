# Android Architecture Components and Room Database

## Android Architecture Components (AAC)

### Introduction to AAC

- AAC is a set of powerful libraries from Google.

- They help developers build robust and maintainable Android apps.

- AAC provides pre-built solutions to common app development problems.

- This makes development easier and more efficient.

- It leads to higher-quality applications.

- AAC consists of best architecture practices and libraries.

- It encourages recommended app architecture.

- It significantly reduces boilerplate code.

- It improves testability due to clear separation of concerns.

- It results in fewer dependencies and easier maintenance.

### Key Components of AAC

- Activity/Fragment: UI controllers that display data and handle UI events.

- ViewModel: Holds UI data and survives configuration changes.  It acts as a single source of truth for app data, providing a clean API for the UI to communicate with.

- Repository: Manages data access, potentially from multiple sources (e.g., network, database).  It acts as a clean interface between the app and data.

- Room Database: An abstraction layer over SQLite, simplifying database interaction.

### Lifecycle-Aware Components

- These components perform actions in response to lifecycle changes of other components.

- An example is a listener starting and stopping based on activity start/stop.

- Use cases include managing location updates, video buffering, network connectivity, and animated drawables based on app visibility and lifecycle state.

- The lifecycle library (android.arch.lifecycle package) provides classes and interfaces for building these components.

## Room Database

### Room Overview

- Room is a robust SQL object mapping library.

- It generates SQLite Android code automatically.

- It provides a simple API for database interaction.

### Components of Room

- Entity: Defines the schema of a database table.  One entity instance represents one row in the table.

- DAO (Data Access Object): Defines read/write operations for the database.  Must be an interface or abstract class.

- Database: A database holder used to create or connect to the database.

### Entities

- Entities are defined as POJO (Plain Old Java Object) classes.

- Member variables correspond to column names.

- Annotations like  @Entity ,  @PrimaryKey ,  @NonNull , and  @ColumnInfo  are used to define table names, primary keys, nullability, and column names.

- Every field stored in the database must be public or have a getter method.

- The  @Relation  annotation defines relationships between entities.

### Data Access Objects (DAOs)

- DAOs provide abstract access to the app's database using methods.

- The data source for these methods are entity objects.

- Room uses DAOs to create a clean API.

- DAOs use  @Query  annotations to define SQL queries.

### Creating a Room Database

- Create a public abstract class extending  RoomDatabase .

- Annotate it with  @Database , specifying entities and version number.

- Declare entities for the database schema.

## LiveData

### LiveData Overview

- LiveData is a data holder class aware of lifecycle events.

- It keeps a value and allows observation of that value.

- It's used to keep the UI up-to-date with the latest data.

- It's observable data, notifying observers when data changes.

- It's lifecycle-aware, knowing when the device rotates or the app stops.

### Using LiveData with Room

- To make data observable, return it as LiveData from DAOs.

- Room generates code to update LiveData when the database is updated.

- LiveData must be used consistently across all layers (DAO, Repository, ViewModel).

### Observing LiveData

- Create an observer in the Activity's  onCreate() .

- Override the observer's  onChanged()  to update the UI when data changes.

- Observers are bound to Lifecycle objects, preventing memory leaks.  They clean up automatically when their associated lifecycle is destroyed.

### LiveData and Lifecycle

- When a lifecycle object becomes inactive, it receives the latest data upon reactivation.

- LiveData handles configuration changes, ensuring the activity or fragment receives the latest data after recreation (e.g., due to rotation).

### Sharing Resources with LiveData

- Extend a LiveData object using the singleton pattern for services or databases.

- This allows any observer to watch the LiveData object for updates.
