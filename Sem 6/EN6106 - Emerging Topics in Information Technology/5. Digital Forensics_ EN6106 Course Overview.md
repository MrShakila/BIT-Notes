# Digital Forensics: EN6106 Course Overview

## Introduction to Forensic Science and Digital Forensics

### Defining Forensic Science

- A scientific discipline applying scientific methods and principles to crime and legal issue investigations.

- Involves collecting, analyzing, and interpreting physical evidence (blood, fingerprints, DNA, fibers) to determine case facts.

- Employs specialized techniques, instruments, and technologies to analyze evidence and reconstruct crime scenes.

- Includes specialized areas like forensic biology, chemistry, toxicology, psychology, and digital forensics.

### Defining Digital Forensics

- Recovers, preserves, analyzes, and presents electronic data stored, transmitted, or processed on digital devices (computers, mobile phones, storage media).

- Focuses on identifying, collecting, examining, and analyzing digital evidence.

- Plays a crucial role in legal and criminal investigations.

- Involves identifying and categorizing types of digital evidence and the tools used to acquire and analyze digital data.

### Types of Digital Evidence

- Digital evidence is information stored or transmitted in binary form, admissible in court.

- Includes computer and mobile device data, email and messaging data, internet and social media data, cloud and network data, audio and video data.

- Metadata (file creation/modification dates and times) helps create timelines of events.

## History and Evolution of Digital Forensics

### History of Computer Crimes and Digital Forensics

- The field emerged due to computer-related crime and the need to investigate digital evidence.

- Computer forensics is rooted in digital forensics.

- Key milestones include the first computer crime in Florida (1978), Canada's pioneering legislation (1983), and the publication of best practices for computer forensics (2002).

### Subcategories of Digital Forensics

- Digital forensics includes computer forensics (post-mortem and live forensics, application forensics, other devices), mobile forensics (Android, iOS, Windows Phone), and network forensics (malware analysis, live network forensics, application forensics).

- The evolution is driven by computer-related crime, the internet's emergence, widespread digital device use, and the development of digital forensic tools and techniques.

### Technological Advances in Digital Forensics

- Imaging technology creates forensic images of storage devices for analysis.

- Data recovery tools recover lost or deleted data, even intentionally hidden data.

- Mobile forensics uses specialized software and tools for mobile device data recovery and analysis.

- Cloud forensics recovers and analyzes cloud-based data.

- Artificial intelligence and machine learning automate analysis, identifying patterns and anomalies in large datasets.

- Blockchain forensics traces and analyzes cryptocurrency transactions.

- Live forensics analyzes digital devices in real-time to respond to security threats.

- Virtualization technology creates virtual environments for forensic analysis, reducing the need for physical hardware.

## Applications and Roles of Digital Forensics

### Applications of Digital Forensics

- Primarily used in criminal law (evidence to support or oppose arguments in court) and private investigations (corporate world, investigating employee misconduct).

- Forensic procedures are similar in both, but legal requirements and limitations differ.

### Role in Law Enforcement

- Cybercrime investigations identify and track cybercriminals using digital evidence (IP addresses, log files, metadata).

- Digital evidence collection proves suspect involvement or provides alibis, using evidence from various digital sources.

- Child exploitation cases uncover evidence of child pornography or related illegal activities.

- Fraud investigations analyze digital records and financial transactions to identify fraudulent activity.

- Terrorism investigations track and identify individuals and groups involved in terrorist activities.

- Courtroom presentations use digital forensic evidence to support prosecutions, with experts testifying in court.

- Investigative efficiency is improved by reducing the time and resources needed to investigate crimes.

## Digital Forensics Procedures

### Digital Forensic Investigation Phases

- Digital forensic investigation involves collecting, preserving, analyzing, and presenting admissible digital evidence.

- The process has four phases: identification, collection, examination, and analysis.

- These phases are critical and typically followed sequentially.

### Identification Phase

- The first step in a digital forensics investigation.

- Gathers information from stakeholders (law enforcement, corporate security, legal teams).

- Determines the scope and objectives of the investigation.

- Identifies potential sources of digital evidence (computers, mobile phones, external hard drives, cloud storage).

- Identifies potential locations of digital evidence (email accounts, social media, cloud storage, online repositories).

- Identifies relevant metadata (date, time, location, creator).

- This phase is crucial for identifying and preserving all potential sources of digital evidence.

### Collection Phase

- Gathers all potential sources of digital evidence identified in the previous phase.

- Includes physical devices and digital data stored remotely or in the cloud.

- Uses various tools and techniques (imaging hard drives, creating forensic copies of mobile devices, network sniffing).

- Collects evidence forensically to ensure admissibility in court.

- Can be time-consuming and requires attention to detail.

- Creates a detailed chain of custody for each piece of evidence.

- Requires legal authorization (search warrant) before collecting evidence.

- May involve interviewing witnesses and conducting investigative work to identify additional sources of evidence.

### Examination Phase

- Carefully examines the collected digital evidence.

- Uses various techniques (specialized software, manual analysis).

- Determines the relevance and significance of the evidence.

- Identifies patterns or connections between different pieces of evidence.

- Ensures only relevant and significant evidence is analyzed in subsequent phases.

- Yields three types of evidence: inculpatory (supporting a given history), exculpatory (contradicting a given history), and evidence of tampering.

### Analysis Phase

- Reviews and interprets digital evidence to draw conclusions and develop a report.

- Looks for patterns, connections, and meaningful relationships.

- May use specialized software (data recovery, network analysis, decryption tools).

- Provides a clear and detailed report of evidence and findings for legal proceedings or other contexts.

## Example Use Case: Cybercrime Investigation

### A large retail company reports a data breach.

### The identification phase determines the extent of the breach and specific compromised data.

### The collection phase secures servers, creates forensic images, collects relevant evidence (server logs, network traffic), and interviews employees.

### The examination phase uses specialized software to recover stolen data and analyze logs and traffic for suspicious activity.

### The analysis phase analyzes recovered data to determine the breach's scope and impact, identifies compromised data, assesses harm to affected individuals, and identifies patterns in network traffic to pinpoint the attack's source.

## Skills Required for Digital Forensics Investigation

### Outstanding thinking capabilities to apply tools and methodologies, identify patterns, and make correlations.

### Technical skills in networks and digital systems.

### Passion for cybersecurity.

### Communication skills to coordinate with teams and extract information.

### Skillful report making with attention to detail.
