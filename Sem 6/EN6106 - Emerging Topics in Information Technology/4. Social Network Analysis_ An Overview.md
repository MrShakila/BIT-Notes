# Social Network Analysis: An Overview

## Introduction to Social Networks

### Defining Social Network Analysis (SNA)

- SNA uses mathematical and statistical tools to analyze relationships and interactions among individuals, groups, or entities.

- In SNA, each individual or entity is a node or vertex, and connections/relationships are edges or links.

- SNA studies various social phenomena like communication patterns, influence, collaboration, and the spread of information or disease.  Analyzing patterns and structures provides insights into group function, idea/behavior spread, and social change.

### Network Representation

- Networks are represented visually as graphs.

- Actors are represented as nodes (vertices, points).

- Ties/connections are represented as edges (arcs, lines, links).

- Examples of social relationships include family, friendship, and customer relationships.

## Goals of Analysis

### Understanding Community Dynamics

- The goal of SNA is to gain insight into a community by examining relationships between its members, represented as a network.

- Analysis involves identifying key individuals and groups, as well as connections and associations (components).

- Networks consist of nodes linked by connections.  In social networks, nodes represent people, and links represent various social connections (friendships, family ties, financial relationships).

### Applications of Social Network Analysis

- SNA is useful for understanding the scope and impact of gangs.

- It provides insights into gang reach, activity, and influence on individuals and communities.

- One application is identifying individuals at risk of gang involvement or exploitation.  A systematic approach offers objectivity, replicability, and wider applications compared to qualitative methods.  It helps understand local gang issues and relationships, aiding community impact statements and interventions.  It also allows for targeted responses by differentiating between core and peripheral gang members, improving gang-related work.  Data can be centrally collected and provided to local teams for addressing specific issues.

## Variables and Relations

### Graph Theory Fundamentals

- A graph visually represents a set of objects with connecting links.

- Objects are vertices (points), and links are edges.

- A graph is a pair of sets (V, E), where V is the set of vertices and E is the set of edges connecting vertex pairs.

- Each node is a vertex, identifiable by an array index.  A line or path connecting two vertices is an edge, representable using a two-dimensional array.  Two vertices connected by an edge are adjacent. A sequence of edges between two vertices is a path.

### Cluster Analysis

- Cluster analysis detects graph elements with similar properties, especially crucial in large networks.

- It groups elements/entities based on similarity measures (topological criteria, node location, or other characteristics).

- Nodes with similar measures are grouped into clusters, each containing elements sharing common properties and characteristics.  The collection of all clusters is a clustering.

## Mathematical Foundation

### Graph Theory

- Graph theory is the branch of mathematics most relevant to SNA.

- A graph is a set of nodes (vertices) connected by edges (links).

- In SNA, nodes represent individuals or groups, and edges represent relationships.  There are directed graphs (edges have direction) and undirected graphs (edges don't have direction).  The degree of a node is the number of edges incident to it. Paths are sequences of nodes connected by edges.

### Centrality Measures

- Centrality measures node importance in a network.

- Types include degree centrality, betweenness centrality, and eigenvector centrality.

- Centrality measures identify influential individuals, information brokers, and key connectors. They provide insights into information flow, power distribution, and control. Different centrality measures capture various aspects of node importance. Centrality analysis helps understand network structure, dynamics, and key actors. It has applications in social sciences, organizational studies, marketing, and public health.  It enhances understanding of social interactions and network behavior.  Degree centrality measures connections a node has.  High degree centrality indicates high connectivity and influence. Betweenness centrality measures a node's position in connecting other nodes. High betweenness centrality nodes act as bridges, controlling information flow. Eigenvector centrality considers both the number of connections and their importance.  High eigenvector centrality nodes connect to other important nodes, indicating influence or prestige. Closeness centrality measures how quickly a node can access or reach other nodes. Nodes with high closeness centrality have shorter average path lengths, enabling efficient information flow.

### Matrix Algebra

- An adjacency matrix is a square matrix representing a graph using Boolean values (0s and 1s).  Each element indicates a direct path or edge between two vertices.

- An incidence matrix represents connections between nodes and edges.  In an undirected graph with n vertices and m edges, the incidence matrix is an n x m matrix.  A row represents each vertex, and a column represents each edge.  The number of 1s in the incidence matrix (without loops) equals the sum of the degrees of all vertices.  A Laplacian matrix measures connectivity and properties of a graph. A modularity matrix analyzes community structure within a graph.

## Data Collection

### Data Collection Methods

- Overview of different methods for collecting data on social networks.

- Surveys: Asking respondents to identify connections and describe relationships. Advantages include large-scale data collection. Limitations include biases like social desirability and recall bias.

- Observation: Directly observing individuals/groups and recording relationship dynamics. Advantages include rich, real-time data. Limitations include time consumption and feasibility issues.

- Online data collection: Gathering data from platforms like social media, online communities, and forums. Advantages include large amounts of diverse data. Limitations include selection bias and privacy concerns.

- Specialized methods include snowball sampling (starting with a few individuals and expanding through connections), name generators (asking respondents to list contacts), and name interpreters (having respondents interpret contact names).

### Considerations for Choosing a Data Collection Method

- Factors to consider when selecting a method for collecting social network data.

- Goals: Aligning the method with the research question.

- Target population: Considering characteristics and accessibility.

- Resources: Assessing available resources.

- Strengths and limitations: Evaluating advantages and disadvantages.

## Data Management

### Importance of Data Management

- Data management is crucial for data organization (structuring data to analyze relationships effectively), accuracy and reliability (standardizing data, removing errors and duplicates), accessibility and retrieval (easy access to specific information), integration (combining data from multiple sources), documentation and reproducibility (transparent documentation for sharing and replicability), and security and privacy (protecting sensitive information). Effective data management ensures quality, organization, accessibility, and reliability, leading to accurate and meaningful insights.

### Data Management Definition and Purpose

- Data management in social networks involves organizing, maintaining, and ensuring data quality on relationships between individuals or groups.

- Its purpose is to ensure the integrity, usability, and accessibility of collected data.  It involves practices like data organization, accuracy enhancement, integration of multiple datasets, documentation, and data security.  Effective data management enables efficient analysis and meaningful insights.

### Methods of Data Management

- Manual data entry (entering data into a database or spreadsheet by hand; time-consuming and error-prone).

- Spreadsheets (using software like Microsoft Excel or Google Sheets; limitations with large datasets and complex analysis).

- Specialized software (e.g., Gephi, UCINET, Pajek; offers advanced features but requires technical skills).

### Best Practices for Effective Data Management

- Standardizing data (applying consistent formatting to ensure uniformity and compatibility).

- Cleaning data (removing duplicates, checking for errors, and filling in missing data).

- Storing data (using secure and organized systems, such as databases or cloud-based storage).

- Documenting data (keeping track of sources, methods, and relevant information to enhance transparency and reproducibility).

## Multivariate Analysis

### Introduction to Multivariate Analysis

- Multivariate analysis is a statistical method used to analyze relationships between multiple variables in a network.

- It helps understand variable relationships, identify patterns, and find trends in data.

### Types of Multivariate Analysis Techniques

- Regression analysis: Examining relationships between two or more variables (understanding how changes in one variable relate to changes in another).

- Factor analysis: Identifying underlying factors or dimensions (reducing data complexity by grouping similar variables).

- Cluster analysis: Grouping individuals or nodes based on similarities in multiple variables (identifying subgroups or communities).

- Multidimensional scaling: Visualizing relationships between variables (identifying patterns or clusters of variables).

### Considerations for Multivariate Analysis in Social Network Analysis

- Variable selection: Choosing relevant variables aligned with the research question.

- Statistical methods: Employing appropriate techniques to test significance and control for confounding variables.

## Visualizations

### Introduction to Visualization in Social Network Analysis

- Visualization is a fundamental aspect of SNA, enabling exploration and understanding of network structure and patterns.

- It helps identify important nodes and actors, revealing clusters and communities.

### Types of Visualizations in Social Network Analysis

- Node-link diagrams: Common visualizations depicting nodes as circles/dots and relationships as lines/edges (revealing overall network structure and highlighting centrality).

- Matrix diagrams: Visual representations of node relationships in a matrix format (uncovering patterns and clusters).

- Heat maps: Matrix diagrams using color to represent relationship strength (visualizing relationship strength intuitively).

- Force-directed layouts: Visualization techniques positioning nodes based on relationships using algorithms (unveiling clusters, subgroups, and overall network structure).

### Considerations for Effective Network Visualization

- Choosing appropriate visualization techniques that best suit the data.

- Clear labeling and design (using descriptive labels, suitable color schemes, and legends).

- Interactivity and exploration (incorporating interactive features to allow users to explore and manipulate the visualization).
