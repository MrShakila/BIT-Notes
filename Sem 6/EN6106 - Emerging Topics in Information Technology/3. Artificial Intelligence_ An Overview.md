# Artificial Intelligence: An Overview

## What is Artificial Intelligence?

### Introduction to AI

- AI is a branch of computer science focused on creating intelligent machines capable of performing tasks requiring human intelligence.

- John McCarthy, considered the father of AI, defined it as "the science and engineering of making intelligent machines, especially intelligent computer programs."

- AI draws upon various disciplines, including computer science, mathematics, statistics, engineering, linguistics, and biology.

### Human vs. Machine Intelligence

- Human intelligence involves learning, reasoning, problem-solving, social behavior, and sensory interaction with the environment.

- Machines often excel in speed, sensor detection beyond human capabilities, computations, alertness, and simultaneous activities.

- AI aims to "teach" computers tasks typically requiring human intelligence while leveraging existing machine capabilities.

- Examples include speech recognition, decision-making, natural language understanding, image recognition, and object detection.

- This is achieved through computational methods like machine learning algorithms and neural networks, enabling machines to learn from data.

### A Brief History of AI

- The concept of AI emerged with the development of modern computers in the 1940s and 1950s.

- Early pioneers like Alan Turing explored self-modifying and self-improving machines, laying the groundwork for modern AI.

- Allen Newell and Herbert Simon attempted to build intelligent programs using logical rules.

- John McCarthy developed the List Processing Language (Lisp), a standard tool for AI research.

- The modern era of AI began in the 1970s, with advancements in expert systems, pattern recognition, and neural networks.

- The 1990s saw further progress with computer vision, virtual reality, natural language processing, and data mining.

- Recent popular applications include Tesla Autopilot, ChatGPT, IBM Watson Health, and PayPal's fraud detection system.

### Initial Dilemmas of AI

- The initial challenge in AI, as articulated by Alan Turing, was creating machines with human-like thinking and reasoning abilities.

- The Turing Paradigm evaluates a machine's ability to exhibit human-like intelligence indistinguishably from a human.

- Other AI paradigms emerged, including:

	- Connectionist Paradigm: Modeling brain structure and function to develop artificial neural networks.

	- Evolutionary Paradigm: Using evolutionary algorithms and genetic mutation to optimize problem solutions.

	- Bayesian Paradigm: Identifying relationships between variables and calculating probabilities.

	- Fuzzy Logic Paradigm: Handling situations with multiple possibilities beyond simple true/false values.
