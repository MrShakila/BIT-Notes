# Microservices Architecture: A Comprehensive Overview

## Monolithic Architecture

### Characteristics of Monolithic Architecture

- All functionalities are implemented and deployed within a single software application.

- Examples include enterprise software applications like ERPs and CRMs.

- SOA/web services often exhibit coarse-grained services with broad scopes, encompassing numerous operations and complex message formats.  An online retail application, for instance, might incorporate inventory, shipping, and store services within a single monolithic structure.

### Drawbacks of Monolithic Architecture

- Developed and deployed as a single unit, leading to complexity in maintenance, upgrades, and feature additions.

- Updating a single part requires redeploying the entire application.

- Scaling is challenging due to conflicting resource requirements.

- Reliability issues arise as one unstable service can bring down the entire application.

- Agile development and delivery methodologies are difficult to implement.

## Microservices Architecture

### Fundamentals of Microservices Architecture

- The core principle is developing a single application as a suite of fine-grained, independent services, each running in its own process and deployed independently.

- This is more than just segregating services within a monolith; it involves independent development and deployment.  An online retail application, for example, would be broken down into separate microservices for inventory, accounting, shipping, and store management.

### Designing Microservices: Size, Scope, and Capabilities

- Adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP), maintaining a limited and focused business scope for each microservice.

- Define service boundaries aligned with business capabilities.

- Design for agile and independent development and deployment.

- Focus on appropriate service size, not necessarily minimizing size.

- Unlike web services, microservices should have few operations and simple message formats, potentially refactoring to smaller boundaries over time based on business needs.

## Messaging in Microservices

### Messaging in Monolithic vs. Microservices Architectures

- Monolithic architectures utilize function calls, language-level method calls, or SOA/web services (SOAP and WS* with HTTP, JMS, etc.) with potentially dozens of operations and complex message schemas.

- Microservices architectures employ simpler, lightweight messaging mechanisms.

### Synchronous and Asynchronous Messaging

- Synchronous messaging involves the client awaiting a timely response from the service.  REST and Thrift are common communication protocols.

- Asynchronous messaging means the client doesn't expect an immediate response or may not require one at all.  AMQP, STOMP, and MQTT are examples of asynchronous messaging protocols.

### Message Formats and Service Contracts

- Common message formats include JSON, XML, Thrift, Protocol Buffers, and Avro.

- Service contracts, defined using Swagger, RAML, or Thrift IDL, specify service interfaces.

## Integrating Microservices (Inter-service Communication)

### Integration Strategies

- Microservices require communication structures.  While SOA/web services used ESBs, microservices aim to eliminate central message buses, moving business logic to services and clients ("Smart Endpoints").  Services are connected through "dumb pipes."

- Three common integration styles are point-to-point (direct service invocation), API Gateway (centralized routing), and Message Broker (asynchronous communication).

### Point-to-Point, API Gateway, and Message Broker Styles

- Point-to-point involves direct communication between services and clients.

- API Gateway style uses a central gateway to route requests to the appropriate microservices.

- Message Broker style uses a message broker for asynchronous communication between services.

## Data Management

### Data Management in Monolithic vs. Microservices Architectures

- Monolithic applications typically use a centralized database.

- Microservices often employ decentralized data management, with each microservice having its own private database.

### Decentralized Data Management

- Each microservice maintains a private database for its specific data.

- A microservice only accesses its own database, not those of others.

- Complex transactions might require updating multiple databases, necessitating service API updates.

- Migrating from a monolithic system with a single database schema to a microservices-based system can be challenging.

## Decentralized Governance

### Governance in Microservices

- Governance involves establishing and enforcing how people and solutions work together to achieve organizational objectives.  This includes design-time and run-time governance.

- Microservices architectures generally lack centralized design-time governance, allowing individual services to make their own decisions.

- Run-time governance aspects (SLAs, throttling, monitoring, security, service discovery) are often implemented at the API Gateway level.

## Service Registry and Service Discovery

### Service Registry and Service Discovery Mechanisms

- The service registry holds microservice instances and their locations.

- Service discovery mechanisms locate available microservices and their locations.  This can be client-side (clients directly query the registry) or server-side (a load balancer queries the registry).

## Microservice Deployment

### Microservice Deployment Principles

- Microservices should be independently deployable and undeployable.

- Scaling should be possible at the individual microservice level.

- Building and deployment should be quick.

- Failure in one microservice shouldn't affect others.

### Docker and Kubernetes for Deployment

- Docker is a popular method for packaging and deploying microservices as container images.

- Kubernetes extends Docker's capabilities by managing clusters of containers across multiple hosts, providing co-location, service discovery, and replication control.  An online retail application's microservices can be deployed and scaled using Docker and Kubernetes.

## Security with Microservices

### Security in Monolithic vs. Microservices Architectures

- Monolithic applications often have a central security component at the beginning of the request handling chain.

- Microservices typically implement security at each service level, often leveraging a central user repository/store.  OAuth2 and OpenID Connect are widely used API security standards.

### OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect

- OAuth 2.0 uses access tokens (opaque, containing no user information) for authentication.

- OpenID Connect extends OAuth 2.0 by adding ID tokens (containing user information), often implemented with JWTs ("by-value tokens").  JWTs are not safe for use outside internal networks.  Microservice security often integrates OAuth2 and OpenID Connect.

## Transactions

### Handling Transactions in Microservices

- Supporting distributed transactions across multiple microservices is complex.

- Microservices architecture encourages transaction-less coordination.

- Mandatory transaction requirements can be met using compensating operations.

## Design for Failures

### Designing for Failure in Microservices

- Microservices increase the likelihood of individual service failures.

- Unavailable or unresponsive microservices shouldn't bring down the entire system.

- Microservices should be fault-tolerant, capable of recovery, with graceful client handling.  Error handling patterns like circuit breakers, timeouts, and bulkheads are crucial.

## Orchestrating Microservices

### Orchestration at the Microservices Layer vs. Gateway Layer

- Orchestration can occur at the microservices layer (individual services manage dependencies) or at the gateway layer (the gateway manages orchestration logic).

- Orchestration at the gateway layer is generally not recommended as it violates microservices principles by embedding business logic within the gateway.

## Microservices in Modern Enterprises

### Inner and Outer Architecture

- The inner architecture comprises the core microservices components.

- The outer architecture provides the platform capabilities needed to build a solution around the microservices.

### Modern Enterprise Architecture

- Modern enterprise architecture integrates microservices, enterprise integration, and API management.  This often involves a gateway for managing access, security, and routing to various microservices, potentially integrating with external systems via an integration server.

## Migrating to Microservices

### Challenges of Migration

- Migrating from a monolithic system to a microservices-based system is challenging.

- A gradual approach is often necessary.

- Many systems end up with hybrid architectures combining monolithic and microservices elements.

## Microservices - Case Study

### A Netflix case study ("Mastering Chaos") illustrates the challenges and benefits of microservices.

## Microservices - Conclusion

### Microservices are not a panacea; they won't solve all enterprise IT needs.

### Complete conversion of existing enterprise systems to microservices is often impractical.

### Enterprise integration remains necessary.

### Microservices are exposed as APIs, and inter-service communication should be managed via lightweight orchestration or within another microservice.
