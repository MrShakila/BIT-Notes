# Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) with Jenkins and Git

## Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD)

### Understanding CI and CD

- CI is a method of continuously verifying codebase condition through automated testing, best achieved with version control integration.

- CD is an approach to regularly deploying artifacts that successfully pass the CI phase for confident deployment.

- CI, CD, and continuous deployment share the goal of faster, more robust software development and release, differing mainly in automation scope.

### CI and CD Phases and Pipelines

- CI involves code pushes to a Version Control System (VCS), build server checks, developer feedback, and code storage in a repository.

- CD ensures reliable, quick, and frequent software releases, aiding automated deployment.

- CI/CD pipelines visually represent the process, from code in a Git repository through various testing stages to final deployment.

### Characteristics of Good CI/CD

- Good CI features decoupled stages (each step performs a specific task), repeatability (consistent and repeatable automation), and fast failure detection.

- Good CD involves system-focused design (covering application, infrastructure, configuration, and data), pipelines that increase confidence towards production, and globally unique versions for tracking system state.

- Developers, QAs, and system administrators should all understand CI/CD.  Many tools exist for CI/CD, including Jenkins, GitLab, Bamboo, and others.

## Setting up Jenkins

### Jenkins Overview and Functionality

- Jenkins is a widely used open-source tool for continuous integration and building software development projects.

- It allows manual, periodic, or automatic builds, and uses plugins for deployment and automation.

- It supports various languages and team sizes.

- It is programmed using Java.

### Jenkins Plugins and CI/CD Process

- Jenkins uses plugins for source code management (Git), build tools (Maven), code quality analysis (Sonar), and testing frameworks (JUnit).

- A typical CI/CD process using Jenkins involves developers committing code changes, the CI server pulling the code and triggering a build, building the application for testing, and finally deploying to production.  Concerned teams are notified throughout the process.

### Jenkins Master-Slave Architecture

- Jenkins uses a master-slave architecture to handle multiple machines and distribute the workload for testing on various browsers and operating systems.

- The master schedules jobs and monitors slaves, while slaves execute the build jobs.

### Jenkins Installation Prerequisites and Process

- Prerequisites include JDK 1.7 or above, 2GB RAM (recommended), sufficient disk space, and a supported operating system (Windows, various Linux distributions, macOS).

- Installation involves downloading the LTS release, running the jenkins.war file using Java, and optionally changing the port.

- The Git plugin should be installed and Jenkins restarted.

## Jenkins Pipeline Process

### Jenkins Pipeline Overview

- Jenkins Pipeline (or "Pipeline") is a suite of plugins for implementing and integrating continuous delivery pipelines.

- It uses a domain-specific language (DSL) for pipeline creation.

- Pipeline-as-code involves writing the pipeline definition in a Jenkinsfile, stored in the project's source control repository.

### Benefits of Using Jenkinsfile

- Automates Pipeline build processes for all branches and pull requests.

- Enables code review and iteration on the Pipeline.

- Provides an audit trail.

- Creates a single source of truth for the Pipeline.

### Declarative vs. Scripted Pipeline Syntax

- Jenkinsfiles can use Declarative or Scripted syntax.

- Declarative Pipeline is newer and easier to write and read.

- Declarative Pipeline offers richer syntactical features.

- While syntax differs, commonalities exist between Declarative and Scripted Pipelines.

### Jargon in Jenkins Pipeline

- Pipeline: The code encompassing the complete build process.  A pipeline block is essential in Declarative syntax.

- Node: A machine in the Jenkins environment capable of running a Pipeline. A node block is crucial in Scripted syntax.

- Stage: A logically distinct set of tasks (e.g., Build, Test, Deploy).  Plugins use this information for status display.

- Step: An individual action or command (e.g., using the 'sh' step to execute a shell command).  Plugins often introduce new steps.

### Setting up a Basic Jenkins Pipeline

- Requires Jenkins 2.x or later and the Pipeline plugin.

- Create a new Pipeline project in the Jenkins Classic UI.

- Choose the Pipeline script option and enter the Pipeline code.

- The 'agent' directive allocates an executor and workspace.

- The 'echo' step writes to the console.

- Save and run the Pipeline using the 'Build Now' option.  View the results in the Build History and Console Output.

### Creating a Jenkinsfile

- A Jenkinsfile defines a Jenkins Pipeline and is saved in a source control repository.

- A basic three-stage continuous delivery pipeline (Build, Test, Deploy) is a common starting point.

### Example Jenkinsfile and Pipeline Stages

- The example Jenkinsfile uses Declarative Pipeline syntax.

- The 'agent' directive assigns an executor and workspace.

- The 'stages' directive defines the pipeline stages.

- The 'steps' directive specifies the actions within each stage.

- The 'when' expression in the Deploy stage ensures it only runs after successful Build and Test stages.

## Introduction to Version Control Systems (VCS)

### Understanding VCS

- Version control (or source control) monitors and handles software code modifications.

- VCSs are software applications that oversee code alterations over time.

### Features of VCS

- Back-up methodology.

- Recording increments to track live versions.

- Maintaining change history.

- Allowing multiple developers (remotely) to work on the same codebase.

- Merging changes across files.

- Tracking who made changes.

- Point-in-time marking (tagging).

- Branching for parallel development and release version maintenance.

### Centralized vs. Distributed VCS

- Centralized VCSs have a single central repository.

- Distributed VCSs allow each developer to have a full copy of the repository.

### VCS Jargon

- Repository (repo): Database storing files.

- Server: Computer storing the repository.

- Client: Computer connecting to the repository.

- Working copy: Local directory of files.

- Trunk/Main: Master code location.

- Head: Latest revision.

### Actions Performed in VCS

- Add: Place a file under version control.

- Check in: Send local changes to the repo.

- Check out: Download from repo to working copy.

- Ignore: Exclude files from version control.

- Revert: Restore a previous revision.

- Update/Sync: Update working copy to the latest revision.

- Diff/Change: Specific modification.

- Branch: Duplicate copy for feature development.

- Merge: Integrate changes from branches.

- Conflict: Inability to reconcile changes.

- Resolve: Manually fix conflicted changes.

- Locking: Prevent other developers from making changes.

### Example VCSs

- Concurrent Versions System (CVS)

- Subversion (SVN)

- Git

- Bazaar

- Mercurial

- Monotone

- Visual Source Safe (VSS)

## Git

### Git Overview

- Git is a distributed revision control system developed by Linus Torvalds.

- It supports non-linear development.

- It's compatible with macOS, Linux, Windows, and various protocols (HTTP, FTP, SSH).

- It efficiently handles projects of all sizes.

### Git Project Sections

- Working directory: Local files.

- Staging area: Files prepared for commit.

- Git directory (repository): Stores project history.

### Installing Git

- On Linux (Fedora/CentOS):  sudo dnf install git-all 

- On Linux (Debian/Ubuntu):  sudo apt install git-all 

- On macOS: Install Xcode Command Line Tools or use a binary installer.

- On Windows: Download from the Git for Windows website or use Chocolatey.

### Initializing a Git Repository

-  git init  creates a new Git repository.

-  git add  stages files for tracking.

-  git commit  saves changes with a message.

### Viewing Commit History

-  git log  displays commit history.

### Creating and Merging Branches

-  git branch  creates a new branch.

-  git checkout  switches branches.

-  git merge  merges branches.
