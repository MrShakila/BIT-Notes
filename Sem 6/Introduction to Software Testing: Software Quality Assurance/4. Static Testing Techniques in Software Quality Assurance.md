# Static Testing Techniques in Software Quality Assurance

## Static Methods in Software Testing

### Definition and Objective of Static Testing

- Static testing examines software work products manually or with tools without execution.

- It analyzes various documents including source code, design documents, requirement specifications, test plans, and user manuals.

- The primary goal is to improve software quality by helping engineers identify and fix defects early in the development process.

- It begins early in the software development life cycle.

### Types of Defects Easily Found Through Static Testing

- Deviation from standards

- Missing requirements

- Design defects

- Non-maintainable code

- Inconsistent interface specifications

### Documents Testable Through Static Testing

- Business Requirements Document (BRD)

- Functional or system requirements

- Unit use cases

- Prototype and prototype specification documents

- Test data

- Database field dictionary spreadsheets

- Documentation, training guides, and user manuals

- Test cases/test plan strategy documents

- Traceability matrix documents

- Performance test scripts/automation

### Types of Static Methods

- Static testing encompasses two main categories: review and static analysis.

- Review methods include formal and informal approaches.

- Static analysis utilizes tools to assess code quality against standards, identifying defects like unused variables, dead code, infinite loops, variables with undefined values, and syntax errors.

## Benefits of Static Testing

### Cost and Time Savings

- Lowered costs in the initial development phase due to reduced rework for error correction.

- Reduced development time.

- Early feedback improves overall functionality, leading to fewer errors in later testing phases.

- Improved software code maintainability.

- Better understanding of software quality issues for developers.

### Process Improvement

- Automated tools expedite code and document review.

- Enhanced communication between teams.

## Types of Reviews

### Informal Reviews (Buddy Check, Pairing, Pair Review)

- Characterized by detecting potential defects; may also generate ideas or solutions.

- Not based on a formal documented process; may not involve a meeting.

- Can be performed by a colleague (buddy check) or multiple people.

- Results may or may not be documented; usefulness varies depending on the reviewer.

- Checklist use is optional; commonly used in Agile development.

- A simple example is one person asking a colleague for a quick look at their work.

- Other forms include pair programming, where one person continually reviews the other's work as it's being typed.

### Walkthroughs

- Aims to find defects, improve the software product, consider alternative implementations, and evaluate conformance to standards.

- May also exchange ideas, train participants, and achieve consensus.

- Individual preparation is optional; the review meeting is typically led by the author.

- A scribe is mandatory; checklists are optional.

- May use scenarios, dry runs, or simulations; defect logs and review reports may be produced.

- The author does most of the preparation.

- Participants from different departments are not required to study the work product beforehand.

- Useful for higher-level work products like requirement specifications and architectural documents.

- Often used to transfer knowledge and educate a wider audience.

### Technical Reviews

- Aims to gain consensus and detect potential defects.

- May also evaluate quality, build confidence, generate new ideas, motivate authors, and consider alternative implementations.

- Reviewers should be technical peers or experts.

- Individual preparation is required; the review meeting is optional, ideally led by a trained moderator (not the author).

- A scribe is mandatory (ideally not the author); checklists are optional.

- Defect logs and review reports are typically produced.

- Often focuses on achieving consensus on technical content after participants have studied the work product.

- Defects are found by experts focusing on the work product's content.

- Experts may include architects, chief designers, and key users.

- An independent facilitator is useful, especially with conflicting opinions.

- Less formal than inspections but generally more formal than walkthroughs; formality can vary.

### Inspections

- Aims to detect potential defects, evaluate quality and build confidence, and prevent future defects through author learning and root cause analysis.

- May also motivate authors and improve future work products and the development process; achieves consensus.

- Follows a defined process with formal documented outputs, using rules and checklists.

- Clearly defined roles are mandatory, including a dedicated reader who reads/paraphrases the work product aloud.

- Individual preparation is required.

- The most formal review type.

- Work products are thoroughly prepared and checked by reviewers before the meeting using rules and checklists.

- Defects are logged in the meeting; discussion is postponed until later.

- Inspections can balance multiple goals (e.g., time to market and efficiency).

- When done well, inspections identify defects and improve processes, benefiting both authors and reviewers.

## Summary of Static Testing

### In static testing, software products and source code are examined without execution to identify issues.

### Static testing starts early in the software development life cycle.

### The static testing techniques discussed are informal review, walkthrough, technical review, and inspection.
