# Software Quality Assurance: 5 Levels of Testing

## Functional Testing

### Overview of Functional Testing

- Functional testing validates software against functional requirements and specifications.

- Its main purpose is to test each function by providing input and verifying the output against functional requirements.

- It can be done manually or using automation, checking aspects like user interface, APIs, databases, and security.

### Component/Unit Testing

- Also known as "unit" or "module" testing, it searches for defects and verifies the functioning of separately testable software items.

- Goals include reducing risk, identifying defects, validating performance, developing confidence in quality, and preventing defects from escaping to higher levels.

- It may be done in isolation using "mock objects," "stubs," and "drivers" to simulate interfaces.  A stub is called from the component, while a driver calls the component.

### Integration Testing

- Integrates software modules and tests them as a group.

- Aims to find issues in how modules interact when combined.

- Includes component integration testing (focusing on interactions between components, performed after component testing, often automated, and the responsibility of developers) and system integration testing (focusing on interactions between systems, packages, and microservices; may involve external organizations; often the responsibility of testers).

### System Testing

- Concerned with the behavior of the whole system/product.

- May include tests based on risks, requirement specifications, business processes, and use cases.

- Objectives include reducing risk, verifying compliance with requirements, validating completeness, building confidence in overall quality, finding defects, and preventing defects from escaping to later testing or production.

### User Acceptance Testing

- Conducted in a real or simulated operational environment by intended users.

- Aims to build confidence that the system enables users to perform tasks efficiently.

- Includes types like Contract Acceptance Testing (CAT), Regulations Acceptance Testing (RAT), Operational Acceptance Testing (OAT), and Alpha and Beta testing.

## Non-Functional Testing

### Overview of Non-Functional Testing

- Evaluates compliance of a component or system with non-functional requirements.

- Characteristics include measurability (no subjective characterization), correct identification of quality attributes, and prioritization of requirements.

- Parameters include interoperability, performance, scalability, security, loading capacity, stability, and reliability.

### Interoperability Testing

- Ensures software interacts with other components and systems.

- Proves end-to-end functionality between communicating systems as specified by requirements.

- Includes data type, semantic, physical, protocol, and data format interoperability testing.  It is particularly significant for systems based on the Internet of Things (IoT), web services, systems of systems, and commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) software.

### Performance Testing

- Determines the actual system performance compared to expectations.

- Metrics vary by application, testing speed, response time, stability, reliability, scalability, and resource usage.

- Aims to identify and eliminate performance bottlenecks.

### Stress Testing

- Evaluates behavior under extremely heavy load.

- Ensures acceptable performance under worst-case conditions; recovery mechanisms should be invoked if limits are exceeded.

- Targets problems like memory leaks and buffer allocation/memory carving.  Testing from different locations (inside and outside the system) is recommended.

### Regression Testing

- Verifies that no defects are introduced into unchanged portions of a system due to changes elsewhere.

- Addresses scenarios where a reported defect is fixed, not fixed, fixed but something else fails, or not fixed and something else fails.

- Since testing every case for every version is expensive, a subset of test cases is carefully selected to maximize defect uncovering and reduce costs.

## Documentation Testing

### Documentation Testing Overview

- Verifies technical accuracy and readability of user manuals, tutorials, and online help.

- Levels include read tests (reviewing for clarity, organization, and accuracy without execution), hands-on tests (exercising online help and verifying error messages), and functional tests (following instructions to verify system functionality).

- Concrete tests include verifying grammar, terminology, graphics, glossary standards, indexes, internal consistency, and the equivalence of online and printed versions.  It also includes verifying troubleshooting guides, installation procedures, and configuration sections.
