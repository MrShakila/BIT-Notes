# Introduction to Software Testing: Software Quality Assurance

## Understanding Software, Quality, and Assurance

### Defining Software

- Software is a set of machine-readable instructions for a computer's processor.

- IEEE (1991) defines software as computer programs, procedures, and associated documentation and data for computer system operation.

- ISO (1997) defines software as computer programs, procedures, documentation, and data necessary for operating the software system.  All four components are essential for assuring software development quality.

### Defining Software Quality

- IEEE (1991) offers two definitions:  the degree to which software meets specified requirements, and the degree to which it meets customer needs or expectations.

- The first definition focuses on meeting a written specification.

- The second definition prioritizes customer satisfaction and fulfilling real needs.

### Quality Assurance vs. Testing

- Quality assurance (QA) is not the same as testing.

- QA is part of quality management, encompassing software development, human resources, and delivery processes.  It ensures standard procedures are followed correctly.

- Testing is a quality control activity.

- Testing is essential but insufficient alone; it should be integrated into a comprehensive, team-wide quality assurance process.

- QA supports good testing.

### Software Quality Assurance

- IEEE Glossary (1991) defines software quality assurance (SQA) as a planned, systematic pattern of actions to ensure a product meets requirements, and as activities to evaluate the development process.

- SQA involves planning and integrating actions across all development stages.

- SQA extends beyond development to encompass service and delivery.

- SQA includes non-technical aspects like scheduling and budget.

- A broader definition includes systematic, planned actions to ensure the software development or maintenance process conforms to functional and managerial requirements, including schedule and budget.

### Quality Assurance vs. Quality Control

- Quality control evaluates the quality of a finished product, withholding anything that doesn't meet standards.

- Quality assurance detects and prevents errors early, aiming to reduce the cost of ensuring quality.

- Quality control is a subset of quality assurance activities.

## Objectives of Software Quality Assurance and Testing

### Objectives in Development

- Ensure software meets functional and technical requirements.

- Ensure software meets managerial scheduling and budgetary requirements.

- Initiate and manage activities to improve the software development process and SQA activities.

### Objectives in Maintenance

- Ensure software maintenance activities meet functional and technical requirements.

- Ensure maintenance activities meet managerial scheduling and budgetary requirements.

- Initiate and manage activities to improve the efficiency of software maintenance and SQA activities.

### Objectives of Testing

- Verify that all specified requirements are met.

- Find failures and defects (a primary focus).

- Provide information to stakeholders for informed decisions on quality.

- Reduce the risk of inadequate software quality.

- Ensure compliance with contractual, legal, or regulatory requirements and standards.

## Testing and Debugging

### Testing vs. Debugging

- Testing and debugging are different concepts.

- Debugging is a software development activity where a developer identifies, analyzes, and removes a defect.

- Testing detects system defects and resulting failures.

- Further testing is needed after debugging to ensure functionality.

- Testers may conduct initial and final confirmation tests while developers debug.

- In Agile, testers may participate in debugging.

### Testing in Different Software Development Stages

- Requirement reviews and user story refinement: Detects defects early, reducing risks of incorrect or untestable software.

- System design: Improves stakeholder understanding and reduces design defect risks.

- Coding: Increases understanding of the code and reduces defect risks.

- Before release: Detects failures and ensures the software meets stakeholder requirements.

## Software Errors, Faults, and Failures

### Defining Errors, Faults, and Failures

- Software engineering involves human error (grammatical or logical).

- Errors can become software faults (defects), causing improper functioning.

- Not all faults become failures; a failure occurs when a fault causes unexpected behavior during execution.

- Only some errors become faults, and only some faults become failures.

### Root Causes of Defects

- A root cause is a source of defects; removing it reduces or eliminates the defect type.

- Root causes are the earliest actions or conditions causing defects.

- Root cause analysis should be conducted to prevent similar defects.

- Root causes are often organizational issues.

### Causes of Software Errors

- Identifying causes is crucial for avoiding poor-quality software.

- Errors can occur in any phase and be caused by any stakeholder.

- Causes include time pressure, human error, inexperienced personnel, code complexity, miscommunication, misunderstandings, and unfamiliar technologies.

- Errors can be code, procedure, documentation, or data errors.

- Galin [2] classifies errors into nine categories based on development stage: faulty requirements, communication failures, deliberate deviations, logical design errors, coding errors, non-compliance with documentation, testing shortcomings, procedure errors, and documentation errors.

### Specific Error Causes

- Faulty requirements: erroneous, incomplete, or unnecessary requirements.

- Communication failures: misunderstandings of instructions, changes, responses, or lack of attention.

- Deliberate deviations: reusing modules without analysis, omitting functionalities, or introducing improvements without approval.

- Logical design errors: erroneous algorithms, process definitions, or omitted system states.

- Coding errors: misunderstandings in design, linguistic errors, errors in using tools, or data selection errors.

- Non-compliance: ignoring documentation and coding standards.

- Testing shortcomings: incomplete plans, poor error reporting, or failure to correct errors.

- Procedure errors: misinterpreting system requirements due to procedural errors.

- Documentation errors: errors in design documents or user manuals.

## Manual vs. Automation Testing

### Manual vs. Automation Testing

- Manual testing involves human execution without scripts.

- Automation testing uses tools and scripts to automate testing tasks.

- Automation improves efficiency, reduces costs, and shortens testing time.

- Automated tests include code auditing, coverage monitoring, functional tests, load tests, and test management.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Automation Testing

- Advantages: accuracy and completeness of performance, higher accuracy in documentation, comprehensive information, less manpower, and shorter testing periods.

- Disadvantages: high investment in purchasing and training, high development costs, high manpower for test preparation, and some testing areas may be left uncovered.

## Seven Testing Principles

### Testing shows the presence, not absence, of defects.

### Exhaustive testing is impossible.

### Early testing saves time and money.

### Defects cluster together.

### Beware of the pesticide paradox (repeating the same tests loses effectiveness).

### Testing is context-dependent.

### Absence of errors is a fallacy.

## Software Quality Assurance Models and Standards

### ISO 9000-3

- ISO 9000-3 guidelines from the International Organization for Standardization address software development and maintenance.

- It emphasizes eight quality management principles: customer focus, leadership, involvement of people, process approach, system approach to management, continual improvement, factual approach to decision making, and mutually supportive supplier relationships.

- Certification requires developing an SQA system (quality manuals and procedures, staff training), implementing it, and undergoing certification audits.

### Capability Maturity Models (CMM and CMMI)

- CMM focuses on improving an organization's software development process.

- CMMI integrates agile principles into CMM to improve development processes, configuration management, and quality management.

### Bootstrap Model

- The Bootstrap methodology measures organizational and project maturity based on 31 quality attributes categorized into process, organization, and technology.

### Benefits of Using Software Quality Assurance Standards

- Using sophisticated methodologies and procedures.

- Better understanding and cooperation among stakeholders.

- Obtaining SQA certifications through independent audits.

## Summary

### Software quality assurance is a planned, systematic approach to ensure products meet requirements and to evaluate the development process.

### Quality control focuses on withholding unqualified products.

### Debugging and testing are distinct; debugging fixes defects, while testing detects them.

### Software errors, faults, and failures are different concepts.

### Galin [2] categorizes software errors based on development stages.

### SQA standards promote the use of sophisticated methodologies and better understanding among stakeholders.
