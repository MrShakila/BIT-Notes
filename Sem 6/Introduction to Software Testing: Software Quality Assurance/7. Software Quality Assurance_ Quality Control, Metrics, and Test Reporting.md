# Software Quality Assurance: Quality Control, Metrics, and Test Reporting

## Test Monitoring and Control

### Objectives of Test Monitoring and Control

- Monitor the test plan and schedule to stay on track.

- Monitor key project parameters.

- Conduct progress and milestone reviews to determine the actual status and replan as needed.

- Monitor risks and take appropriate action.

- Analyze issues and change requests, taking appropriate action.

- Track corrective actions to closure.

- Monitor resources and manage resource issues.

- Report the test status to management.

### Responsibilities in Test Monitoring and Control

- The test manager is responsible for monitoring and control, ensuring appropriate corrective action is taken to address risks and issues.

- Regular status reports communicate testing progress to stakeholders.

- Test monitoring and control provide feedback and visibility on test operations, including corrective action when performance deviates from expectations.

### Sample Process Map for Test Monitoring and Control

- The process involves monitoring progress against the plan, identifying risks/issues, managing corrective actions, and ensuring all actions are closed.  This is a cyclical process.

## Metrics Used in Testing

### Defining Metrics in Testing

- Metrics provide quantitative answers to specific questions, offering an objective view of goal attainment.

- A variety of test and business metrics provide visibility into key areas and demonstrate how metrics facilitate improvement.

### Customer Satisfaction Metrics

- Monthly quality or operational reviews reveal improvement patterns in metrics over time.

- Sample metrics include customer satisfaction, project management of testing, execution of testing, customer care, and cost of quality.

- Charts illustrate customer satisfaction surveys, showing arrival rates and satisfaction levels across different customers and various aspects of the software (quality, timeliness, ease of use, etc.).  Numerical interpretations are provided to clarify the meaning of the scores.

### Project Management Metrics for Testing

- Metrics provide visibility into the test manager's effectiveness in completing testing on time, within budget, and with the right quality.

- Charts show schedule accuracy (planned vs. actual) and effort estimation accuracy (planned vs. actual) across different projects.

- Timeliness metrics are lagging indicators, showing on-time delivery after the testing is complete.  Careful tracking of activities is necessary to address slippage or delays.  Effort estimation is a key component in calculating cost and scheduling.

### Test Execution Metrics

- Metrics provide visibility into the testing process.

- Charts illustrate the number of defects and change requests, their severities, and their status (open, closed).

- Charts also show the age of open defects, problem arrival rates, and phase containment effectiveness.  The goal is to minimize defects found after acceptance testing and product release.  Cumulative arrival rate curves indicate product stability.  Charts also show the arrival and closure rates of problems, indicating project stability and effectiveness in resolving defects.  Another chart shows the status of problems (raised, open, closed) but not their severity.

## Customer Care Metrics

### Goals and Metrics for Customer Care

- Customer care aims to respond efficiently and effectively to customer problems, ensure high service standards, and ensure reliable product function at customer sites.

- Metrics track effectiveness in resolving customer queries, the number of queries raised, system availability at customer sites, and the age of open queries.

- A customer query may lead to a defect report if a software problem is identified.

### Customer Care Charts and Analysis

- Charts show the arrival and closure rates of customer queries, highlighting potential backlogs.

- Charts also present outage information, showing the customers impacted and the duration of outages.  Post-mortems are conducted to prevent recurrence.

- Metrics track system availability and outage time per month.

## Cost of Quality

### CMMI Maturity and Cost of Poor Quality

- Metrics apply to various organizational areas, including CMMI maturity and the cost of poor quality (COPQ).

- A chart shows internal CMMI maturity, using a 1-10 scale to rate process areas. A score of 7 or higher indicates satisfaction.

- According to Crosby, the most meaningful quality measurement is the cost of poor quality (COPQ).  Improvement activities should focus on reducing COPQ.

### Components of Cost of Quality

- COPQ includes the cost of external and internal failure, the cost of preventative infrastructure, and the cost of verification infrastructure.

- A chart shows the cost of quality over time, broken down into external, internal, prevention, appraisal, and total costs.

## Purposes, Contents, and Audiences for Test Reports

### Test Report Purpose and Frequency

- A test report summarizes all test activities and final results of a testing project.

- Reporting frequency is defined in the project test plan or communication plan; IEEE standard 829 provides guidance for test summary reports.

### Test Report Content and Audience

- Test reports advise management and stakeholders on testing status, including key project information (summary of activities and results, completed deliverables, new risks and issues, schedule/effort/budget status, key risks and issues, milestone status, and planned activities/deliverables).

- The test manager discusses the report with management, presenting the current status, key risks, and issues, and explaining how issues are being addressed and risks managed.

- Management considers the test manager's plans for dealing with risks and issues, providing support.

- The project manager presents a recovery plan (exception report) if the project deviates significantly from its defined tolerance.

## Summary of Testing Metrics and Reports

### Testing metrics estimate progress and quality in software testing.

### Various metrics measure software quality, considering key risks and issues.

### Metrics track quality, timeliness, cost, schedule, and effort.

### They provide an internal view of software quality; external behavior requires further examination.

### Test reports are crucial for determining software readiness for customer release.
