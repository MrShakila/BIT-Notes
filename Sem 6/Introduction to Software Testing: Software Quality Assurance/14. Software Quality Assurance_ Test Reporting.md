# Software Quality Assurance: Test Reporting

## Test Reporting Process

### Understanding Test Reports

- A test report summarizes all test activities and final results of a testing project.

- It evaluates the success of testing.

- Stakeholders use it to assess product quality and decide on software release.  They may postpone release if many defects remain.

- Test summary reports are ideally prepared after the testing cycle is complete, allowing sufficient time before product shipment.

- Daily status reports provide daily updates, while test summary reports offer a consolidated overview of the entire testing cycle.

### Content of a Test Summary Report

- Concise and relevant information is crucial.

- Report templates vary depending on the project.  A typical report includes:

	- Test objective: The purpose of testing.

	- Areas covered: Functionalities tested.

	- Areas not covered: Untested areas.

	- Testing approach: Methods and processes used.

	- Defect report: Defects identified and described.

	- Platform details: Testing environments and platforms.

	- Overall summary: Feedback on the application's status.

### Steps to Create a Test Summary Report

- Step 1: Define the document's purpose with a short description.

- Step 2: Provide an overview of the application tested.

- Step 3: Detail the testing scope, including in-scope, out-of-scope, and untested areas due to constraints or dependencies.

- Step 4: Capture metrics such as planned, executed, passed, and failed test cases.

- Step 5: Document the types of testing performed to ensure proper application testing, including details of multiple testing rounds.

- Step 6: Describe the test environment (application URL, database version, etc.) and tools used, including bug management tools.

- Step 7: Document critical issues encountered and solutions implemented.

- Step 8: Include recommendations or suggestions for stakeholders.

- Step 9: Define exit criteria (successful test case execution, closed critical issues, action plans for open issues).

- Step 10: Indicate testing team approval for live system deployment and exit criteria fulfillment.  Sharing reports within the team is also important.

## Test Reporting Frameworks

### What are Test Frameworks?

- A test framework provides guidelines for coding standards, test data handling, object repository testing, etc.

- These are guidelines, not mandatory rules.

- They create a consistent interface between code and tests.

### Benefits of Using Test Frameworks

- Improved test efficiency.

- Lower maintenance costs.

- Minimal manual intervention.

- Maximum test coverage.

- Code reuse.

- Easier handling of recovery scenarios.

- Easy reporting.

### Common Types of Test Frameworks

- Linear Scripting Framework: Tests are independent, often created by recording and replaying manual actions.

- Module Based Framework: The application is tested in smaller parts (functions, modules, sub-systems). Tests can be combined for system-level testing.

- Library Based Framework: Reusable libraries are created for better maintenance and scalability.

- Behavior Driven Framework: Tests are written descriptively for business stakeholder understanding, focusing on behaviors and user scenarios.

- Data Driven Framework: Tests use different input data from databases or spreadsheets, separating test scripts and input data to avoid hard-coding.

- Keyword Driven Framework: An extension of data-driven, using keywords to define test steps, mapped to objects and actions in a shared repository.  Promotes reuse.

- Hybrid Testing Framework: Combines multiple frameworks to leverage their strengths and mitigate weaknesses.

## Software Tools for Test Reporting

### What are Test Reporting Tools?

- Software providing reporting, decision-making, and business intelligence capabilities.

- They extract and present data in charts, tables, and other visualizations.  Examples include Katalon, SpiraTest, Testim, Allure, and more.

### Why are Test Reporting Tools Required?

- Early bug detection: Tools identify critical bugs early, avoiding manual code review.

- Easier analysis:  Provides insights into project status and alignment with business requirements.

- Progress tracking: Helps monitor product development progress.

### Criteria for Choosing Test Reporting Tools

- User interface: Clean and easy to use.

- Usability: Easy to learn and master.

- Flexibility: Compatibility with various automation tools.

- Functionality and features: Comprehensive and relevant reports.

- Value: Reasonable price relative to features and use case.

### Key Features of Commonly Used Tools

- Test case management.

- Test execution management.

- Defect management.

- Traceability.

- Customizable reports.

- Dashboards for key quality metrics (release readiness, pass/fail trends).

- Real-time data tracking.

- Failure classification by root cause.
