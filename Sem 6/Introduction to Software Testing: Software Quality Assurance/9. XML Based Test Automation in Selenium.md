# XML Based Test Automation in Selenium

## Introduction to XML Path in Selenium

### What is XPath?

- XPath is an XML path language used for navigating through the HTML structure of a webpage.

- It's a syntax for locating any element on a webpage using XML path expressions.

- It leverages the HTML DOM structure to find elements.  If standard locators (id, class, name) fail, XPath is used.

### XPath Syntax

- XPath contains the path of an element on a webpage.

- The basic format is:  Xpath=//tagname[@Attribute='Value']   where  tagname  represents the element type,  Attribute  is an attribute of the element, and  Value  is the attribute's value.

### XPath Locators in Selenium

- Selenium uses various locators to find elements.

- These include ID, Classname, Name, Link text, XPath, and CSS path.

- XPath is particularly useful for finding dynamic elements and traversing between elements.  CSS path is used for elements lacking name, class, or ID.

### Types of XPath

- Absolute XPath: The complete path to an element starting from the root node.

- Relative XPath: A shorter, more flexible path starting from an element within the DOM, not the root node.

## Absolute XPath

### Characteristics and Disadvantages

- Absolute XPath directly locates elements.

- It begins with a single forward slash ( / ), indicating selection from the root node.

- A major disadvantage is that it fails if the element's path changes.

### Identifying Absolute XPath in Chrome

- Right-click the element and select "Inspect."

- Right-click the highlighted HTML element and select "Copy XPath."

- Paste the copied XPath into the search bar and press Enter; the relevant element will be highlighted.

### Example of Absolute XPath

- An example of an absolute XPath is:  /html/body/div[1]/section/div[1]/div/div/div/div[1]/div/div/div/div/div[3]/div[1]/div/h4[1]/b 

## Relative XPath

### Characteristics and Advantages

- Relative XPath starts from the middle of the HTML DOM structure.

- It uses a double forward slash ( // ).

- It avoids lengthy paths by starting from a middle element.

- Elements are found by searching the relative XPath in the browser's inspect tool.

### Example of Relative XPath

- An example is:  //*[@class='featured-box']//*[text()='Testing'] 

## Finding Elements using Attributes with XPath

### Basic XPath Expressions

- XPath expressions select nodes based on attributes like ID, Name, and Classname.

- Examples include:  //input[@type='text'] ,  //label[@id='message23'] ,  //input[@value='RESET'] ,  //a[@href='http://demo.guru99.com/'] .

### Contains() Method

-  Contains()  is used when attribute values change dynamically (e.g., login information).

- It finds elements with partial text matches.  For example, if the 'name' attribute is 'btnLogin', using  contains(@name, 'btn')  will find it.

### Using OR and AND Expressions

- OR expressions find elements if any condition is true.  Example:  //*[@type='submit' or @name='btnReset'] 

- AND expressions require both conditions to be true. Example:  //input[@type='submit' AND @name='btnLogin'] 

### Starts-with() Function

-  Starts-with()  finds elements whose attribute values change dynamically on refresh or other operations.

- It matches the starting text of an attribute.  It can also find elements with static attribute values.

### Text() Function

-  Text()  is a built-in Selenium function to locate elements based on their text content.

- The text must be in string form.  Example:  //td[text()='UserID'] 

### XPath Axes

- XPath axes are methods to find dynamically changing elements.

- They search different nodes in an XML document from the current context node.

- Common axes include Child, Parent, Ancestor, Sibling, Preceding, Self, Following, Following-sibling, and Descendant.

### Following Axis

- Selects all elements in the document after the current node.

- Example:  //*[@type='text']//following::input 

### Ancestor Axis

- Selects all ancestor elements (grandparent, parent, etc.) of the current node.

- Example:  //*[text()='Enterprise Testing']//ancestor::div[1] 

### Child Axis

- Selects all children elements of the current node.

- Example:  //*[@id='java_technologies']//child::li[1] 

### Preceding Axis

- Selects all nodes that come before the current node.

- Example:  //*[@type='submit']//preceding::input[1] 

### Following-sibling Axis

- Selects the following siblings of the context node (at the same level).

- Example:  //*[@type='submit']//following-sibling::input 

### Parent Axis

- Selects the parent of the current node.

- Example:  //*[@id='rt-feature']//parent::div[1] 

### Self Axis

- Selects the current node itself.

- Example:  //*[@type='password']//self::input 

### Descendant Axis

- Selects all descendants of the current node.

- Example:  //*[@id='rt-feature']//descendant::a 

## Summary

### XML Path is used to find and operate on web page elements.

### XPath has absolute and relative types.

### XPath axes methods find dynamic elements, and XPath expressions select nodes based on attributes.
