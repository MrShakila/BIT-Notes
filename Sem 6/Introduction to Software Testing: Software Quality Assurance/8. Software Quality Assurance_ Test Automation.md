# Software Quality Assurance: Test Automation

## Introduction to Test Automation

### What is Test Automation?

- Automation testing uses software tools to develop and execute tests.

- Tools input test data, compare expected and actual results, and generate reports.

### Why Automate Software Testing?

- Improves accuracy, quality, and test coverage.

- Makes test execution faster.

### When to Automate

- Regression testing:  Suitable when the software application is stable.

- Smoke testing: Provides a quick high-level assessment of software build quality.

- Static & Repetitive Tests: Automates unchanging, repetitive tasks.

- Data Driven Testing: Validates functions with numerous data sets.

- Load & Performance Testing: No viable manual alternative.

### Which Tests to Automate?

- Business critical test cases and critical flows.

- Smoke tests to determine software stability.

- Tests difficult to perform manually (complex calculations, tedious steps).

- Stable test cases or modules (avoid automating unstable components).

### Types of Automation Tests

- Functional Automated Tests: Verify software fulfills business requirements (Tools: Selenium, UFT, RFT, VSTS).

- Non-Functional Automated Tests: Test non-functional requirements (performance, security, compliance) (Tools: Jmeter, LoadRunner).

## Choosing the Right Test Automation Tool

### Key Factors in Tool Selection

- Compatibility with platforms and technologies (operating systems, application types, mobile platforms).

- User-friendliness and flexibility for testers of all skill levels (keyword testing vs. scripting).

- Features like record-and-playback and checkpoint verification.

- Ability to create maintainable and reusable tests adaptable to UI changes.

- Integration with existing ecosystem (CI/CD pipeline, test management, defect management, source control).

- Ability to test enterprise applications (SAP, Oracle, Salesforce, Workday).

### Steps for Choosing a Tool

- Step 1: Identify Requirements (project scope, testing needs, desired functionalities).

- Step 2: Evaluate Tools and Vendors (consider gathered information, create a shortlist).

- Step 3: Estimate Cost and Benefit (perform cost-benefit analysis for shortlisted tools).

- Step 4: Make the Final Decision (test the tool in a real-world setting, schedule meetings with the project team and consultants).

## Effective Use of Test Automation Tools

### Training the Testing Team

- Provide training on automation concepts, terminology, and the chosen tools.

- Familiarize external automation architects with the product, manual testing process, and organizational expectations.

- Allow time for experimentation and finding the most effective automation strategy.

- Provide training on existing organizational tools (bug tracking, requirements management).

- Ensure effective communication between manual testers, developers, and the automation team.

### Creating the Test Automation Framework

- The automation architect develops a long-term framework to support automated testing.

- The framework provides guidelines and strategies for creating easily maintainable test scripts.

- Different framework types exist: linear, modular, data-driven, keyword-driven, hybrid.

### Developing an Execution Plan

- Choose appropriate execution environments (operating system, browser, hardware).

- Write scripts to run on multiple browsers if necessary.

- Communicate environment details before scripting.

- Specify who will execute the scripts (automation team, developers, dedicated resource, unattended mode).

### Writing Test Scripts

- Write scripts in an orderly fashion, using proper naming conventions.

- Maintain source code in source control for version control and history.

- Follow best programming practices.

### Reporting

- Use the tool's reporting feature or develop custom reporting mechanisms (e.g., automated emails).

- Generate reports (charts, tables) as needed.

- Keep management informed about test case coverage (automated vs. remaining manual tests).

### Maintenance of Test Scripts

- Maintenance is usually easy with best practices and a good framework.

- Update scripts immediately if application changes occur.

- Poor frameworks and lack of best practices make maintenance difficult and can cause project failure.

- Automation architects are expensive due to their expertise in creating robust and maintainable frameworks.

## Test Automation Environments

### Test Automation Environments Explained

- A test environment (or test bed) combines software and hardware for testing.

- It may include test data.

- Establishing the right environment is crucial for success; mistakes lead to extra costs and work.

### Components of a Test Environment

- Systems and applications

- Test data

- Database servers

- Client operating systems

- Browsers

- Server operating systems

- Hardware

- Networks

- Necessary documentation (reference documents, configuration guides, installation guides, user manuals)

### Process of Software Test Environment Setup

- Tests are limited by what can and cannot be tested.

- Involved personnel: System admins, developers, testers, sometimes users or techies.

- Setup involves various distinct areas.

### Steps in Test Environment Setup

- Step 1: Test Server Setup (not all tests run on local machines; may need a test server).

- Step 2: Network Setup (internet, LAN/WiFi, private network to avoid impacting other teams).

- Step 3: Test PC Setup (configure PCs according to application needs; different OS and browsers).

- Step 4: Bug Reporting Tools (provide testers with bug reporting tools).

- Step 5: Creating Test Data (duplicate production data for testing, anonymize sensitive data).  Anonymization methods include blacklist and whitelist approaches.  Obtain data strategically using SQL scripts.

### Test Environment Management

- Involves managing and maintaining the test environment.

- Activities include: maintaining a central repository, managing environments based on team needs, establishing new environments, removing outdated ones, investigating issues, coordinating resolutions.

### Challenges in Test Environment Management

- Inadequate resource planning (negative impact, conflicts).

- Remote environments (geographic location issues, support team dependency).

- Elaborate setup time (complex setups for integration testing).

- Shared usage by teams (concurrent use can corrupt results).

- Complex test configurations (intricate configurations can be challenging).

### Best Practices for Test Environment Management

- Thoroughly understand and communicate test requirements.

- Verify connectivity before testing.

- Ensure necessary hardware, software, licenses, browsers, and versions are available.

- Plan scheduled use of the environment, automation tools, and configurations.

## Manual Testing vs. Test Automation

### This section compares manual and automation testing across several criteria: accuracy, testing at scale, turnaround time, cost efficiency, user experience, areas of specialization, and user skills.  A table summarizes the key differences.

## Benefits and Risks of Test Automation

### Advantages of Test Automation

- Speed (faster than manual testing).

- Reliability (consistent results).

- Repeatability (easy to repeat tests).

- Coverage (increased test coverage).

- Reusability (tests can be reused across application versions).

### When Test Automation is Beneficial

- Long-run projects (cost-effective for long-term maintenance).

- Many regression tests (reusability is valuable for constantly changing code).

- Time-consuming and complex manual tests (impractical to manually test all features).

- Fairly stable applications.

### Risks of Automation Testing

- Overly ambitious or impractical expectations.

- Overlooking the capabilities of human testers.

- Incorrectly estimating time and effort (tool selection, training, procedure adjustments, maintainability).

- Incompatibility of tools with the test environment.

- Project budget issues.

- Vendor issues (lack of support, unavailable updates, vendor liquidation, free tools becoming licensed).
