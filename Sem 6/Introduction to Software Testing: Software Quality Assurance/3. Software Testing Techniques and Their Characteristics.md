# Software Testing Techniques and Their Characteristics

## Black-Box Test Techniques

### Overview of Black-Box Testing

- Black-box testing involves testing software without knowledge of its internal workings.

- It treats the software as a "black box" with inputs and outputs, ignoring internal structure.

- This technique is suitable for all testing levels where a specification exists.

### Characteristics of Black-Box Testing

- Test conditions, cases, and data are derived from a test basis (requirements, specifications, use cases, user stories).

- Test cases can reveal gaps between requirements and implementation, or deviations from requirements.

- Coverage is measured based on items tested within the test basis.

### Black-Box Testing Techniques

- Equivalence Partitioning: Divides test conditions into groups considered the same, testing only one condition per group.

- Boundary Value Analysis: Tests values at the boundaries between partitions, including valid and invalid boundaries.

- Decision Table Testing: Systematically states complex business rules, aiding test case selection and revealing specification issues.

- State Transition Testing: Used when system aspects can be described as a finite state machine, often visualized with state diagrams.

- Use Case Testing: Identifies test cases that exercise the entire system on a transaction-by-transaction basis.

## White-Box Test Techniques

### Overview of White-Box Testing

- White-box testing uses the software's internal structure to derive test cases.

- It's also known as "glass-box" testing, requiring knowledge of the software's implementation.

- Applicable to all testing levels.

### Characteristics of White-Box Testing

- Test conditions, cases, and data are derived from a test basis (code, software architecture, design, etc.).

- Coverage is measured based on items tested within a selected structure (code or interfaces).

- Specifications are used to determine expected test case outcomes.

### White-Box Testing Techniques

- Statement Testing and Coverage: Tests each program statement at least once; also known as line or segment coverage.

- Decision Testing and Coverage: Exercises decisions in the code, testing code executed based on decision outcomes.  This ensures both true and false outcomes of decisions are tested.

## Experience-Based Test Techniques

### Overview of Experience-Based Testing

- Test cases are derived from the tester's skill, intuition, and experience with similar applications.

- Useful for identifying tests missed by more systematic techniques.

- Coverage and effectiveness vary greatly depending on the tester's approach and experience.

### Experience-Based Testing Techniques

- Error Guessing: Anticipates errors based on the tester's knowledge; success depends heavily on tester skill.

- Exploratory Testing: A hands-on approach with minimal planning and maximum execution, focusing on learning about the software.

- Checklist-Based Testing: Uses checklists to guide testing; provides consistency but may lack repeatability due to high-level nature of checklists.
