# User Authentication and Network Access Control

## Remote User Authentication Principles

### Identification and Verification

- User authentication is fundamental for access control and accountability.

- The process involves two steps: identification (presenting an identifier) and verification (corroborating the binding between the entity and the identifier).

- A user login scenario illustrates these steps.

### Means of Authentication

- Something the individual knows (passwords, PINs, answers to security questions).

- Something the individual possesses (cryptographic keys, smart cards, tokens).

- Something the individual is (static biometrics like fingerprints, retina scans, facial recognition).

- Something the individual does (dynamic biometrics like typing patterns or voice recognition).

### Mutual Authentication

- Mutual authentication protocols allow communicating parties to verify each other's identity and exchange session keys.

- Key issues are confidentiality and timeliness.

- Replay attacks are a significant concern, requiring mechanisms like timestamps and challenge/response to mitigate them.  Examples of replay attacks are provided.  Methods for preventing replay attacks are discussed.

### One-Way Authentication

- In one-way authentication, the sender and receiver don't need to be online simultaneously.

- The email header must be in clear text for store-and-forward protocols to function.

- The mail-handling protocol doesn't require access to the message's plaintext.

- Encrypted emails enable one-way authentication.

## Remote User Authentication Using Symmetric Encryption

### Mutual Authentication

- A two-level hierarchy of symmetric encryption keys provides confidentiality in distributed environments.

- The Needham-Schroeder protocol, while using a trusted Key Distribution Center (KDC), is vulnerable to replay attacks.  The protocol is described with examples.

- Denning's modification adds timestamps to address replay vulnerabilities, but it remains susceptible to suppress-replay attacks if clocks aren't synchronized.  The modified protocol is described with examples.

- A more robust solution is presented to address these weaknesses.  The protocol is described with examples.

### One-Way Authentication

- A limitation is that the sender cannot ensure the recipient is online.

- The protocol doesn't inherently protect against replays; timestamps can help mitigate this.  The protocol is described with examples.

## Kerberos

### A Simple Authentication Dialogue

- Kerberos addresses the problem of users accessing services on servers in an open distributed environment where workstations cannot be fully trusted.

- In an unprotected environment, any client can request service from any server, leading to impersonation risks.

- A centralized authentication server (AS) knowing all user/service passwords is proposed, but this has security and scalability issues.

### A More Secure Authentication Dialogue

- A more secure approach uses an authentication server (AS) and a ticket-granting server (TGS) to minimize password entry and enhance security.

- Replay attacks and lifetime issues remain concerns.

- The system needs to verify that the person using a ticket is the same person to whom it was issued.

- Server authentication to users might also be necessary.

### The Version 4 Authentication Dialogue

- The version 4 dialogue is described in detail, outlining the steps involved in obtaining ticket-granting and service-granting tickets, and client/server authentication.  The protocol is described with diagrams and examples.

### Kerberos Realms and Multiple Kerberi

- The Kerberos server must store user IDs and hashed passwords of all users.

- The Kerberos server shares secret keys with each server.

- Interoperating realms share secret keys between their Kerberos servers.

### Differences Between Version 4 and 5

- Kerberos version 4 has environmental shortcomings (encryption system dependence, internet protocol dependence, message byte ordering, ticket lifetime, authentication forwarding, inter-realm authentication).

- Version 5 addresses these deficiencies with double encryption, PCBC encryption, improved session key management, and enhanced password protection.

### The Version 5 Authentication Dialogue

- The version 5 authentication dialogue is described, detailing the improvements over version 4 in obtaining ticket-granting and service-granting tickets, and client/server authentication.  The protocol is described with examples.

## Remote User Authentication Using Asymmetric Encryption

### Mutual Authentication

- This method uses asymmetric encryption for mutual authentication.  The protocol is described with examples.

### One-Way Authentication

- If confidentiality is paramount, a more efficient approach is presented.

- If authentication is the main concern, a digital signature suffices.

## Federated Identity Management

### Identity Management

- Identity management is a centralized, automated approach to provide enterprise-wide access to resources.

- Single sign-on (SSO) is a central concept.

### Identity Federation

- Identity federation extends identity management across multiple security domains.

- It involves agreements, standards, and technologies enabling portability of identities, attributes, and entitlements across enterprises and applications.

- Federated identity management uses standards for secure identity exchange across domains or heterogeneous systems.

## Network Access Control

### Elements of a Network Access Control System

- The system consists of an access requestor (AR), a policy server, and a network access server (NAS).

## Extensible Authentication Protocol

### Authentication Methods

- EAP-TLS (EAP Transport Layer Security)

- EAP-TTLS (EAP Tunneled TLS)

- EAP-GPSK (EAP Generalized Pre-Shared Key)

- EAP-IKEv2

### Network Access Enforcement Methods

- IEEE 802.1X

- Virtual local area networks (VLANs)

- Firewall

- DHCP management

### EAP Protocol Exchanges

- The exchange process between EAP peer, EAP authenticator, and authentication server (RADIUS) is illustrated.

### EAP Message Flow in Pass Through Mode

- The message flow in pass-through mode is illustrated, showing the sequence of EAP requests and responses.

## IEEE 802.1X Port-Based Network Access Control

### The process is illustrated, showing the EAPOL messages exchanged between the EAP peer, EAP authenticator, and authentication server (RADIUS).
