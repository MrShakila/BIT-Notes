# Transport Layer Security and Related Protocols

## Web Security Considerations

### Web Security Threats

- Integrity threats include data modification, Trojan horse browsers, and message traffic manipulation.  Consequences include information loss and system vulnerabilities. Countermeasures involve cryptographic checksums.

- Confidentiality threats involve eavesdropping and data theft.  Consequences include information and privacy loss. Countermeasures include encryption and web proxies.

- Denial-of-service threats involve disrupting service through various attacks. Consequences are disruptive and prevent users from working.  Prevention is difficult.

- Authentication threats include impersonation and data forgery. Consequences include misrepresentation of users and the acceptance of false information. Countermeasures involve cryptographic techniques.

### Web Traffic Security Approaches

- Network level security uses IP/IPSec to secure protocols like HTTP, FTP, and SMTP over TCP/IP.

- Transport level security uses SSL or TLS over TCP/IP to secure the same protocols.

- Application level security uses Kerberos and S/MIME to secure HTTP and SMTP over TCP/IP and UDP/IP.

## Transport Layer Security (TLS)

### TLS Overview and Architecture

- TLS version 1.2 (RFC 5246) is a general-purpose service implemented as a set of protocols relying on TCP.  It's often transparent to applications.

- TLS is not a single protocol but consists of two layers above TCP: the record protocol and higher-level protocols (handshake, change cipher spec, alert, heartbeat).

- Two key concepts are TLS sessions (associations between client and server) and TLS connections (transient peer-to-peer relationships within a session).

### TLS Session and Connection

- A TLS session is an association between a client and a server, created by the Handshake Protocol.  It defines cryptographic parameters shared across multiple connections.

- A TLS connection is a peer-to-peer relationship; each connection is associated with one session.  Multiple connections can exist within a single session.

### TLS Record Protocol

- The TLS Record Protocol provides confidentiality (using a shared secret key for encryption) and message integrity (using a shared secret key to generate a Message Authentication Code, MAC).

- The protocol operates by fragmenting application data, compressing it, adding a MAC, encrypting it, and appending a header.

### TLS Protocols: Change Cipher Spec, Alert, and Handshake

- The Change Cipher Spec Protocol uses a single message to update the cipher suite for a connection.

- The Alert Protocol conveys TLS-related alerts (warning or fatal) to the peer entity.  Messages are compressed and encrypted.

- The Handshake Protocol authenticates the client and server, negotiates encryption and MAC algorithms, and establishes cryptographic keys.  It occurs before application data transmission.

### Handshake Protocol Details

- The Handshake Protocol involves a series of messages exchanged between client and server.  Message types include hello_request, client_hello, server_hello, certificate, server_key_exchange, certificate_request, server_done, certificate_verify, client_key_exchange, and finished.

- The exchange has four phases: establishing security capabilities, server authentication and key exchange, client authentication and key exchange, and finishing.

### Handshake Protocol Phases

- Phase I (Establish Security Capabilities):  Establishes security parameters (protocol version, session ID, cipher suite, compression method, random numbers).

- Phase II (Server Authentication and Key Exchange): The server may send its certificate, key exchange parameters, and request a client certificate.

- Phase III (Client Authentication and Key Exchange): The client sends its certificate (if requested), key exchange parameters, and may send certificate verification.

- Phase IV (Finish): The client changes the cipher suite and sends a finished message; the server does the same.

### Handshake Protocol Cryptographic Computations

- The Handshake Protocol involves cryptographic computations: creating a shared master secret via key exchange (RSA or Diffie-Hellman), and generating cryptographic parameters from the master secret using a pseudo-random function.

### Heartbeat Protocol

- The Heartbeat Protocol runs on top of the TLS Record Protocol. It sends periodic signals to ensure the connection is alive and prevent closure by firewalls that don't tolerate idle connections.

### SSL/TLS Attacks

- Attacks can target the handshake protocol, record and application data protocols, and the Public Key Infrastructure (PKI).

### TLSv1.3

- TLSv1.3 removes support for compression, ciphers without authenticated encryption, static RSA and DH key exchange, 32-bit timestamps, renegotiation, the Change Cipher Spec Protocol, RC4, and MD5/SHA-224 hashes with signatures.

- It uses Diffie-Hellman or Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman for key exchange and allows for a "one round trip time" handshake.

## HTTPS

### HTTPS combines HTTP and SSL/TLS to provide secure communication between web browsers and servers.

### When HTTPS is used, the URL, document contents, browser form contents, cookies, and HTTP header contents are encrypted.

## Secure Shell (SSH)

### SSH Overview and Protocol Stack

- SSH is a protocol for secure network communications. It's designed to be simple and inexpensive to implement.

- The SSH protocol stack consists of three protocols running on top of TCP: the Transport Layer Protocol, the User Authentication Protocol, and the Connection Protocol.

### SSH Transport Layer Protocol

- Server authentication occurs at the transport layer, based on the server possessing a public/private key pair.

- Two trust models exist: a client-side database associating host names with public keys, or certification by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

### SSH User Authentication Protocol

- This protocol authenticates the client to the server.

- The message exchange involves several steps: client request, server validation, server response with authentication methods, client selection of a method, and authentication success or failure.

### SSH Authentication Methods

- Authentication methods include public key, password, and host-based authentication.

### SSH Connection Protocol

- The Connection Protocol runs on top of the SSH Transport Layer Protocol and uses a secure authentication connection (a tunnel) to multiplex logical channels.

- Four channel types are recognized: session, X11, forwarded-tcpip, and direct-tcpip.

### SSH Connection Protocol Message Exchange

- The Connection Protocol uses messages like SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_OPEN, SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_OPEN_CONFIRMATION, and SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_DATA to manage channel opening, data transfer, and closing.

### SSH Port Forwarding

- SSH port forwarding converts insecure TCP connections into secure SSH connections (SSH tunneling).

- SSH supports local and remote port forwarding.
