# Cloud Security Fundamentals

## Cloud Computing Overview

### Defining Cloud Computing

- Many organizations are shifting IT operations to internet-connected infrastructure (cloud computing).

- NIST defines cloud computing as a model enabling ubiquitous, convenient, on-demand network access to a shared pool of configurable computing resources.  These resources (networks, servers, storage, applications, and services) are rapidly provisioned and released with minimal management effort.

- Essential characteristics include broad network access, rapid elasticity, measured service, on-demand self-service, and resource pooling.

### Cloud Computing Service Models (NIST)

- Software as a Service (SaaS): Consumers use the provider's applications running on a cloud infrastructure, accessible through a thin client interface.  This simplifies software installation, maintenance, and upgrades.

- Platform as a Service (PaaS): Consumers deploy applications onto the cloud infrastructure using programming languages and tools supported by the provider.  PaaS often provides middleware services like databases.

- Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): Consumers provision processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources to deploy and run arbitrary software.  This allows combining basic computing services to build adaptable systems.

### Cloud Computing Deployment Models (NIST)

- Public cloud: Infrastructure is available to the general public or a large industry group, owned by an organization selling cloud services. The provider is responsible for infrastructure and data control.

- Private cloud: Infrastructure is operated solely for an organization, managed by the organization or a third party, and may be on or off-premise. The provider is responsible only for the infrastructure.

- Community cloud: Infrastructure is shared by several organizations with shared concerns (mission, security, policy, compliance). It may be managed by the organizations or a third party.

- Hybrid cloud: A composition of two or more clouds (private, community, or public) bound by standardized or proprietary technology enabling data and application portability.

## Cloud Security Risks and Countermeasures

### Cloud-Specific Security Threats

- Abuse and nefarious use of cloud computing (easy registration and free trials enable attacks).

- Insecure interfaces and APIs (security and availability depend on basic API security).

- Malicious insiders (organizations relinquish direct control, increasing trust in the cloud provider).

- Shared technology issues (underlying infrastructure components not designed for strong isolation in a multi-tenant architecture).

- Data loss or leakage (most devastating impact of a security breach).

- Account or service hijacking (stolen credentials enable access to critical areas).

- Unknown risk profile (clients pass control to the cloud provider on many security issues).

### Countermeasures for Cloud Security Threats

- Abuse and nefarious use: stricter registration, enhanced fraud monitoring, network traffic introspection, monitoring public blacklists.

- Insecure interfaces and APIs: analyze security models, implement strong authentication and access controls with encryption, understand dependency chains.

- Malicious insiders: enforce strict supply chain management, comprehensive supplier assessment, specify human resource requirements, require transparency and compliance reporting, determine breach notification processes.

- Shared technology issues: implement security best practices, monitor for unauthorized changes, promote strong authentication and access control, enforce SLAs for patching and vulnerability remediation, conduct vulnerability scanning and configuration audits.

- Data loss or leakage: implement strong API access control, encrypt data in transit, analyze data protection at design and run time, implement strong key generation, storage, management, and destruction practices.

- Account or service hijacking: prohibit credential sharing, leverage two-factor authentication, employ proactive monitoring, understand security policies and SLAs.

- Unknown risk profile: disclose applicable logs and data, disclose infrastructure details, monitor and alert on necessary information.

## Data Protection in the Cloud

### Data Compromise Methods and Increased Risk

- Data can be compromised through deletion, alteration, unlinking, loss of encoding keys, or unauthorized access.

- The threat of data compromise increases in the cloud due to the number and interactions between risks and challenges unique to the cloud environment.

### Data Protection Strategies

- Data must be secured at rest, in transit, and in use, with controlled access.

- Encryption protects data in transit, but involves key management responsibilities.

- Access control techniques can be enforced, but the cloud provider is involved.

- For data at rest, encrypting the database and storing only encrypted data (with the provider having no access to the key) is ideal.  Corruption and denial-of-service attacks remain a risk.

## Cloud Security as a Service (SecaaS)

### SecaaS Overview and Services

- SecaaS is a package of security services offered by a service provider, offloading security responsibility from the enterprise.

- Typical services include authentication, antivirus, antimalware, intrusion detection, and security event management.

- In cloud computing, SecaaS is a segment of a cloud provider's SaaS offering.

### SecaaS Categories

- Identity and access management (IAM): manages access to resources by verifying identity and granting appropriate access levels. Includes provisioning and deprovisioning.

- Data loss prevention (DLP): monitors, protects, and verifies data security at rest, in motion, and in use.  Can be implemented by the client or the cloud service provider.

- Web security: real-time protection via on-premise software or cloud-based proxying, adding a layer of protection against malware.  May include usage policy enforcement, data backup, traffic control, and web access control.

- Email security: controls inbound and outbound email, protecting against phishing and malicious attachments, enforcing corporate policies. May incorporate digital signatures and encryption.

- Security assessments: third-party audits of cloud services.  The cloud service provider can provide tools and access points.

- Intrusion management: encompasses intrusion detection, prevention, and response using intrusion detection systems (IDSs) and intrusion prevention systems (IPSs).

- Security information and event management (SIEM): aggregates log and event data to provide real-time reporting and alerting.

- Encryption: a pervasive service for data at rest, email traffic, network management information, and identity information.  Involves key management, VPN services, application encryption, and data access control.

- Business continuity and disaster recovery: ensures operational resiliency with backup at multiple locations, failover, and disaster recovery facilities.  Includes flexible infrastructure, redundancy, monitored operations, geographically distributed data centers, and network survivability.

- Network security: allocates access, distributes, monitors, and protects underlying resource services. Includes perimeter and server firewalls and denial-of-service protection.

## Addressing Cloud Computing Security Concerns

### Cloud Security's Ongoing Importance

- Cloud computing security remains crucial as more businesses incorporate cloud services.

- Security failures can negatively impact business interest, prompting providers to improve security mechanisms.

### NIST Security Controls

- NIST recommends various security controls relevant to cloud computing environments, categorized as technical, operational, and management controls.  These include access control, audit and accountability, identification and authentication, system and communication protection, awareness and training, configuration and management, contingency planning, incident response, maintenance, media protection, physical and environmental protection, personnel security system and information integrity, certification, accreditation, security assessment, planning risk assessment, and system and services acquisition.
