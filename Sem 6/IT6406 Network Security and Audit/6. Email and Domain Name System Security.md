# Email and Domain Name System Security

## Email Security

### Internet Mail Architecture

- Email components include the Message User Agent (MUA), Mail Submission Agent (MSA), Message Transfer Agent (MTA), Mail Delivery Agent (MDA), and Message Store (MS).

- The MTA relays messages between mail servers using SMTP.

- The MUA interacts with the user and the MSA submits messages to the MTA.  The MDA delivers messages to the MS.

### Email Formats

- Email message structure, as defined in RFC 5322, consists of header lines and a text body separated by a blank line.  Headers contain keywords like From, To, Subject, and Date.

- Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension (MIME) extends RFC 5322 to address limitations in SMTP, handling various content types.

- MIME header fields include MIME-Version, Content-Type, Content-Transfer-Encoding, Content-ID, and Content-Description.

### Email Threats and Comprehensive Email Security

- Email security threats are classified as authenticity-related, integrity-related, confidentiality-related, and availability-related.

- Standardized protocols addressing these threats include STARTTLS, S/MIME, DNSSEC, DANE, SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.

### S/MIME

- Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extension (S/MIME) enhances the MIME standard with security features.

- It uses RSA technology for authentication and AES-128 with CBC for confidentiality.

- S/MIME provides compression and ensures email compatibility across various systems by converting 8-bit binary streams to printable ASCII.

- S/MIME message content types include Data, SignedData, EnvelopedData, and CompressedData.

### Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)

- PGP is an email security protocol with similar functionality to S/MIME.

- OpenPGP is a standardized version of PGP.

- Key certification differs: S/MIME uses X.509 certificates from Certificate Authorities, while OpenPGP uses a web-of-trust model where users generate their own keys.

- OpenPGP does not include the sender's public key with each message.

## Domain Name System Security

### DNSSEC

- The Domain Name System (DNS) maps domain names to IP addresses.

- DNS Security Extensions (DNSSEC) secures data exchange in DNS using digital signatures.

- DNSSEC protects against forged or altered DNS resource records, providing data origin authentication and data integrity verification.

### DNS-Based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE)

- DANE addresses the risk of compromised Certificate Authorities (CAs) issuing false certificates.

- It replaces reliance on CA security with reliance on DNSSEC security.

- DANE defines the TLSA DNS record type for securely authenticating SSL/TLS certificates.

- DANE can enhance email security when used with SMTP over TLS.

### Sender Policy Framework (SPF)

- SPF standardizes how sending domains identify and assert their mail senders.

- It prevents unauthorized hosts from using a domain name in email headers.

- SPF provides a protocol for Administrative Management Domains (ADMDs) to authorize hosts.

- SPF makes it difficult for senders to spoof their domain.

### DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)

- DKIM cryptographically signs email messages, allowing domains to claim responsibility.

- DKIM authentication is transparent to the end user.

- The sender's private key signs the message, and the receiver's Mail Delivery Agent (MDA) verifies it using the public key retrieved via DNS.

### Domain-Based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC)

- DMARC allows senders to specify policies for handling their mail, the types of reports receivers can send, and the reporting frequency.

- It uses SPF, DKIM, and identifier alignment to verify email authenticity.

- DMARC reporting provides feedback on SPF, DKIM, identifier alignment, and message disposition policies.

- Reports include the sender's DMARC policy, message disposition, SPF and DKIM results, results classified by sender subdomain, and the sending/receiving domain pair.
