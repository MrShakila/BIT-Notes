# IT Infrastructure Auditing and Remediation

## IT Compliance Audit Scope

### Compliance Basics

- Organizational policies define operational goals.

- IT security policies protect information and systems' confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

- COBIT is a widely used IT control framework.

### Introduction to IT Infrastructure Auditing

- Objectives include examining security policies and procedures.

- Verifying controls supporting policies and their effective implementation and monitoring.

- Seven domains of a typical IT infrastructure: User, Workstation, LAN, LAN-to-WAN, WAN, Remote Access, and System/Application.  A diagram illustrates these domains and their interconnections.

### Maintaining IT Compliance

- Compliance is an ongoing process requiring a programmatic approach using processes and technology.

- This involves regular security control assessments, configuration and control management, change management processes, and annual security environment audits.

## Compliance within Specific Domains

### Compliance within the User Domain

- Includes employees (fully trusted), contractors (partial access), and guests/third parties (limited access).

- Relevant documentation includes HR manuals and Acceptable Use Policies (AUPs) for IT assets, internet, and email.

- Key aspects include separation of duties, privilege levels, confidentiality agreements, background checks, and a RACI matrix defining responsibilities and accountabilities.  Security awareness training is crucial for new employees.

### Compliance within the Workstation Domain

- Common devices include UPS, desktop computers, laptops/tablets/smartphones, printers, modems/access points, hard drives, and removable storage.

- Focuses on maximizing Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability (CIA) through access rights and controls.

- Workstation vulnerability management is essential.

### Compliance within the LAN Domain

- Components include connection media, networking devices, servers, networking software.

- LAN traffic and performance monitoring and analysis are key, including optimizing configuration settings and adding security controls.

- Access rights and controls are implemented to maximize CIA.

### Compliance within the LAN-to-WAN Domain

- Components include routers, firewalls, proxy servers, demilitarized zones, honeypots, ISP connections, intrusion detection/prevention systems, data loss/leak security appliances, web content filters, and traffic monitoring devices.

- Monitoring and analysis of LAN-to-WAN traffic and performance are crucial.

- FCAPS (Fault, Configuration, Accounting, Performance, Security) management is essential, along with network management tools and maximizing CIA.

### Compliance within the WAN Domain

- Components include WAN service providers, dedicated lines/circuits, MPLS/VPN WANs, layer 2/3 switches, and backup/redundant links.

- WAN traffic and performance monitoring and analysis, configuration and change management, and management tools are vital.

- Access rights and controls are implemented to maximize CIA.

### Compliance within the Remote Access Domain

- Components include remote users, workstations/laptops, remote access controls/tools, authentication servers, and ISP WAN connections.

- Remote access and VPN tunnel monitoring, traffic and performance monitoring and analysis, configuration and change management, and management tools are necessary.

- Best practices include preventive, detective, and corrective measures to maximize CIA.

## Network Auditing and Assessment Tools

### Nmap (Network Mapper) is used for network exploration and security auditing.

### Wireshark is a network packet analyzer used for troubleshooting, examining security problems, verifying applications, and debugging protocol implementations.

## Network Security Issue Remediation and Infrastructure Hardening

### Assets, Vulnerabilities, Threats, and Exploits

- An asset is any data, device, or component supporting information activities needing protection.

- A vulnerability is a flaw allowing unauthorized access, potentially leading to data manipulation or privilege elevation.

- A threat is a potential danger, such as a malicious hacker.

- An exploit takes advantage of a vulnerability to cause unintended behavior.

### Infrastructure and Vulnerability Assessment (VA)

- Infrastructure includes network devices, services, and servers.

- VA is the process of scanning an information system to identify and document weaknesses.  Motivations for conducting VAs include legal/regulatory constraints, business risks (reputation, financial), and maintaining service continuity.

### VA Techniques and Scoping

- Testing approaches include black box, white box, and grey box testing.

- VA techniques include static analysis (analyzing code structure without exploitation), manual testing (using tester knowledge and experience), and automated testing (using specialized tools). Fuzz testing involves inputting invalid or random data to test system robustness.  Automated tools are available for many of these techniques.

- Scoping a VA involves considering time, budget, resources, and information exposure (black, grey, or white box testing).  A diagram illustrates the VA process, including scoping, reconnaissance, scanning, scoring/categorization/reporting, filtering false positives, and vulnerability analysis.

### Reconnaissance, Scanning, and Reporting

- Reconnaissance aims to gather information in a non-intrusive way (social engineering, internet searching, passive network scanning, dumpster diving).

- Scanning uses tools like Nmap (for open ports and services), ZAP (for web application vulnerabilities), and Metasploit (for vulnerability assessment and penetration testing).

- Vulnerability scoring and reporting often uses the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).

### Vulnerability/Security Issue Remediation and Hardening

- Remediation involves applying security patches/updates and system hardening.

- Hardening involves making a system robust against attacks, including strengthening permissions, using secure algorithms, removing unnecessary data/apps, stopping unused services, and enabling firewalls.  CIS guides are a valuable resource for hardening.
