# Computer and Network Security Concepts: IT6406 Network Security and Audit

## Computer Security Concepts

### Defining Computer Security

- Computer security is the protection of automated information systems to maintain integrity, availability, and confidentiality of resources (hardware, software, firmware, data, and telecommunications).

- This protection aims to meet applicable objectives.

### Key Security Principles

- Confidentiality:  Protecting information from unauthorized access and disclosure, including personal privacy and proprietary data.

- Integrity: Preventing unauthorized modification or destruction of information, ensuring authenticity and non-repudiation.

- Availability: Guaranteeing timely and reliable access to and use of information.

- Authenticity: Verifying the genuineness and trustworthiness of information, ensuring confidence in the validity of transmissions and originators.

- Accountability: Tracing actions of an entity uniquely back to that entity.

## The OSI Security Architecture

### Overview of the OSI Security Architecture

- The OSI security architecture provides a systematic way to define security requirements and characterize approaches to meet them.

- The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) recommends the X.800 Security Architecture for OSI.

- Many vendors have developed security features based on this standard.

### Key Components of the OSI Security Architecture

- Security attacks: Actions that compromise the security of information.

- Security mechanisms: Processes or devices designed to detect, prevent, or recover from security attacks.

- Security services: Processing or communication services enhancing the security of data processing systems and information transfers, using security mechanisms.

## Security Attacks

### Classifying Security Attacks

- Security attacks are categorized as passive or active.

- Passive attacks involve learning or using information without affecting system resources (e.g., eavesdropping).

- Active attacks attempt to alter system resources or affect their operation (e.g., modification, masquerade, replay, denial of service).

### Passive Attacks

- Passive attacks are like eavesdropping or monitoring transmissions.

- The goal is to obtain transmitted information.

- Two types: release of message contents and traffic analysis.

### Active Attacks

- Active attacks involve modification of data streams, creation of false streams, masquerading, replaying data, modifying messages, and denial-of-service attacks.

## Security Services

### Defining Security Services

- Security services are processing or communication services providing specific protection to system resources.

- X.800 divides these services into five categories.

### Types of Security Services

- Authentication: Verifying the authenticity of a communication.

- Access Control: Limiting and controlling access to host systems and applications.

- Data Confidentiality: Protecting transmitted data from passive attacks.

- Data Integrity: Ensuring messages are received as sent, without duplication, insertion, modification, reordering, or replays.

- Nonrepudiation: Preventing senders or receivers from denying a transmitted message.

## Security Mechanisms

### Categorizing Security Mechanisms

- Security mechanisms are categorized as specific or pervasive.

- Specific mechanisms are incorporated into protocol layers to provide OSI security services.

- Pervasive mechanisms are not specific to any OSI security service or protocol layer.

### Specific Security Mechanisms

- Encipherment: Transforming data into an unintelligible form using mathematical algorithms.

- Digital Signature: Cryptographic transformation proving data source and integrity.

- Access Control: Mechanisms enforcing access rights.

- Data Integrity: Mechanisms assuring data unit or stream integrity.

- Authentication Exchange: Ensuring entity identity through information exchange.

- Traffic Padding: Inserting bits to frustrate traffic analysis.

- Routing Control: Selecting physically secure routes.

- Notarization: Using a trusted third party to assure data exchange properties.

### Pervasive Security Mechanisms

- Trusted Functionality: Functionality perceived as correct based on security policy criteria.

- Security Label: Marking designating resource security attributes.

- Event Detection: Detecting security-relevant events.

- Security Audit Trail: Data for independent security audits.

- Security Recovery: Handling requests from mechanisms and taking recovery actions.

## Fundamental Security Design Principles

### Importance of Design Principles

- There are no foolproof techniques to completely exclude security flaws.

- Widely agreed design principles guide the development of protection mechanisms.

### Fundamental Security Design Principles

- Economy of mechanism: Simple and small security measures.

- Fail-safe defaults: Access decisions based on permission, not exclusion.

- Complete mediation: Every access checked against access control.

- Open design: Open, not secret, security mechanism design.

- Separation of privilege: Multiple privileges needed for access.

- Least privilege: Using only necessary privileges.

- Least common mechanism: Minimizing shared functions.

- Psychological acceptability: Mechanisms not interfering with user work.

- Isolation: Isolating public access systems from critical resources.

- Encapsulation: Isolation based on object-oriented functionality.

- Modularity: Separate, protected modules and modular architecture.

- Layering: Multiple, overlapping protection approaches.

- Least astonishment: User interface responding in expected ways.

## Attack Surfaces and Attack Trees

### Defining Attack Surfaces

- An attack surface consists of reachable and exploitable vulnerabilities in a system.

- Examples include open ports, services inside firewalls, code processing data, interfaces, and vulnerable employees.

### Categorizing Attack Surfaces

- Network attack surface: Vulnerabilities over networks (denial-of-service, disruption of links, intruder attacks).

- Software attack surface: Vulnerabilities in application, utility, or operating system code (web server software).

- Human attack surface: Vulnerabilities created by personnel (social engineering, human error, trusted insiders).

### Understanding Attack Trees

- An attack tree is a branching, hierarchical data structure representing potential techniques for exploiting vulnerabilities.

- The root node is the security incident goal.

- Subnodes represent subgoals, with leaf nodes representing attack initiation methods.

- Nodes are AND-nodes or OR-nodes.

- Attack trees effectively exploit information on attack patterns.

## A Model for Network Security

### The Basic Model

- A general model outlines four basic tasks in designing a security service:

	- Designing a security algorithm.

	- Generating secret information for the algorithm.

	- Developing methods for distributing and sharing secret information.

	- Specifying a protocol for principals to use the algorithm and secret information.

## Standards

### Standardization in Security

- Many security techniques and applications are standardized.

- Various organizations promote these standards.

### Key Organizations

- National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST): A U.S. federal agency dealing with measurement science, standards, and technology.

- Internet Society (ISOC): A professional membership society responsible for Internet infrastructure standards.

- International Telecommunication Union (ITU): An international organization coordinating global telecom networks.

- International Organization for Standardization (ISO): A worldwide federation of national standards bodies.
