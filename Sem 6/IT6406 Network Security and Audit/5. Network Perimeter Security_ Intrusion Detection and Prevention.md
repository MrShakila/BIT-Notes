# Network Perimeter Security: Intrusion Detection and Prevention

## Understanding Intruders

### Intruder Classification and Behavior

- Intruders are often referred to as hackers or crackers.

- Three main classes of intruders exist: masqueraders, misfeasors, and clandestine users.

- Each intruder class exhibits distinct behavior patterns, including those of hackers, criminal enterprises, and internal threats.  Examples of these patterns are detailed, outlining specific techniques used by each type of intruder.

### Intrusion Techniques

- The primary objective of an intruder is to gain unauthorized system access or escalate privileges.

- Initial attacks often exploit system or software vulnerabilities to create backdoors.

- Intruders may also attempt to acquire passwords using various methods, such as trying default passwords, short passwords, dictionary words, or information gathered about users.  Other techniques include using Trojan horses or tapping communication lines.

## Intrusion Detection Systems

### Importance and Approaches

- Timely intrusion detection allows for swift identification and removal of intruders before significant damage occurs.

- Effective intrusion detection systems act as deterrents, preventing future intrusions.

- Intrusion detection facilitates the collection of valuable information about intrusion techniques, strengthening prevention measures.

- Approaches to intrusion detection include statistical anomaly detection (threshold and profile-based) and rule-based detection (anomaly detection and penetration identification).

### Audit Records and Statistical Anomaly Detection

- Audit records serve as a fundamental tool for intrusion detection.  Two main approaches are used: native audit records and detection-specific audit records.  Each audit record contains specific fields (subject, action, object, exception-condition, resource-usage, and timestamp).

- Statistical anomaly detection uses threshold analysis and profile-based systems.  Threshold analysis alone is often ineffective against sophisticated attacks.  Profile-based systems characterize past user behavior to detect significant deviations.  This approach relies on analyzing audit records.  Metrics used include counters, gauges, interval timers, and resource utilization.  Tests such as mean and standard deviation, Markov processes, time series analysis, and operational analysis are used to determine if current activity falls within acceptable limits.

### Rule-Based Intrusion Detection and the Base-Rate Fallacy

- Rule-based techniques detect intrusions by observing system events and applying rules to determine suspicious activity.  Examples of such rules are provided.

- The base-rate fallacy highlights the importance of balancing intrusion detection effectiveness with an acceptable false alarm rate.  High false alarm rates lead to system managers ignoring alerts or wasting time analyzing false positives.

### Distributed Intrusion Detection and Honeypots

- Distributed intrusion detection systems face design challenges, including handling diverse audit record formats and ensuring data integrity and confidentiality during transmission.  Centralized and decentralized architectures are possible.

- Honeypots are decoy systems designed to lure attackers away from critical systems, collect information about their activity, and prolong their engagement to allow for response.  They contain fabricated information that legitimate users wouldn't access.

## Intrusion Prevention Systems

### While intrusion detection systems can be passive, intrusion prevention systems should be active inline systems.

### In addition to intrusion detection functions, intrusion prevention systems actively prevent attacks by dropping malicious packets, blacklisting malicious sources, resetting malicious network connections, and configuring firewalls to prevent future attacks.

## Firewalls

### Need for Firewalls and Design Goals

- Organizations require internet connectivity for operations and service provision but this exposes them to external threats.

- Firewalls control network access, ensuring that all traffic passes through them, blocking unauthorized access.

- Firewalls only allow authorized traffic, as defined by security policies.

- Firewalls themselves must be resistant to penetration, often requiring hardened systems and secured operating systems.

### Firewall Types and Basing

- Firewall types include packet filtering firewalls, stateful inspection firewalls, application-level gateways, and circuit-level gateways.  Each type is described in detail.

- Firewall basing options include bastion hosts (critical strong points in network security), host-based firewalls (software modules securing individual hosts), and personal firewalls (controlling traffic between personal computers and networks).

### Firewall Location and Configurations

- DMZ networks use external firewalls at the network edge and internal firewalls to protect the internal network.

- Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) use encryption and special protocols to secure communication over insecure networks.

- Distributed firewalls combine stand-alone firewall devices and host-based firewalls under central administrative control.

## Unified Threat Management (UTM)

### UTM provides multiple security features and services on a single device or service.

### It protects against various security threats.

### It is also known as Next-Generation Firewalls.

### UTM includes features such as anti-virus, anti-spam, content filtering, and web filtering.

### Data Leakage Prevention (DLP) and Deep Packet Inspection (DPI)

- DLP detects and prevents data breaches and leakages.

- DPI uses known intrusion signatures to detect abnormal network traffic in hardware or software systems.
