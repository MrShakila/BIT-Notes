# Wireless Network Security: An Overview

## Wireless Security

### Factors Contributing to Higher Security Risks in Wireless Networks

- Wireless networks are more susceptible to security breaches compared to wired networks due to several factors.

- The open nature of the wireless channel makes it easier for unauthorized access.

- The mobility of wireless devices increases the risk of exposure to insecure networks.

- Shared resources in wireless networks can be vulnerable to attacks.

- The accessibility of wireless networks makes them attractive targets for malicious actors.

### Wireless Network Threats

- Accidental association with unauthorized networks poses a security risk.

- Malicious associations with rogue access points can compromise network security.

- Ad hoc networks, lacking central management, are vulnerable to various attacks.

- Nontraditional networks, often lacking robust security measures, increase the attack surface.

- Identity theft through MAC spoofing is a significant threat.

- Man-in-the-middle attacks intercept and manipulate communication.

- Denial-of-service (DoS) attacks disrupt network availability.

- Network injection attacks introduce malicious code into the network.

### Wireless Security Measures

- Securing wireless transmission is crucial to prevent eavesdropping and data breaches.

- Signal-hiding techniques reduce the range and visibility of wireless signals.

- Encryption protects data transmitted over the wireless network.

- Securing wireless access points involves configuring strong passwords and encryption protocols.

- Securing wireless networks requires a multi-layered approach, including encryption, antivirus software, firewalls, and access control.

## Mobile Device Security

### Security Threats Related to Mobile Devices

- Lack of physical security control increases the risk of theft and unauthorized access.

- Using untrusted mobile devices introduces vulnerabilities to malware and data breaches.

- Connecting to untrusted networks exposes devices to attacks and data theft.

- Using applications from unknown sources can lead to malware infections and data compromise.

- Accessing untrusted content can expose devices to malware and phishing attacks.

- Using location services without proper security measures can compromise user privacy.

### Mobile Device Security Strategies

- Device security measures include enabling auto-lock, password or PIN protection, and disabling auto-complete features.

- Enabling remote wipe allows for the secure deletion of data in case of loss or theft.

- Keeping the operating system and software up-to-date is essential for patching security vulnerabilities.

- Sensitive data should be encrypted or prohibited from storage on the device.

- Traffic security, through encryption and authentication, protects data in transit.

- Barrier security measures protect the network from unauthorized access.

## IEEE 802.11 Wireless LAN Overview

### IEEE 802 Protocol Architecture

- The IEEE 802 standard defines the architecture for wireless local area networks (WLANs).

- The physical layer specifies frequency bands and antenna characteristics.

- The media access control (MAC) layer handles data transmission and reception.  It assembles data into frames with addresses and error-detection fields during transmission and disassembles frames, performing address recognition and error detection upon reception.

### IEEE 802.11 Network Components and Architectural Model

- The IEEE 802.11 architecture consists of several components, including access points (APs) and stations (STAs).

- Access points act as central points for wireless communication within a basic service set (BSS).

- Multiple BSSs can be interconnected through a distribution system.

### IEEE 802.11 Services

- The IEEE 802.11 standard defines various services, including association, authentication, de-authentication, disassociation, distribution, integration, MSDU delivery, privacy, and re-association.  These services ensure secure and reliable communication within the WLAN.

## IEEE 802.11i Wireless LAN Security

### Security Protocols in IEEE 802

- Several security protocols are available within the IEEE 802 standard to protect wireless networks.

- Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is an older protocol with known vulnerabilities.

- Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) is an improved protocol offering enhanced security.

- Robust Security Network (RSN) is the most secure protocol, providing strong authentication and encryption.

### 802.11i RSN Security Specification

- The 802.11i RSN security specification defines key services for secure wireless communication.

- Authentication verifies the identity of wireless devices.

- Access control restricts access to the network based on authentication.

- Privacy with message integrity ensures data confidentiality and prevents unauthorized modification.

### IEEE 802.11i Phases of Operation

- The IEEE 802.11i standard defines several phases of operation to establish and maintain a secure connection.

- Discovery involves access points advertising their security policies using Beacons and Probe Responses.

- Authentication involves wireless stations and the authentication server verifying their identities.

- Key generation and distribution involves negotiating cryptographic keys between wireless stations and access points.

- Protected data transfer ensures secure exchange of data frames through the access point.

- Connection termination securely ends the connection and restores the network to its original state.
