# IT Infrastructure Auditing Concepts

## The Need for Information Systems Security Compliance

### Understanding IT Security Assessments

- Assessing IT security involves managing risk through identifying and categorizing information systems, selecting and implementing appropriate security controls, assessing their effectiveness, authorizing systems based on accepted risks, and continually monitoring controls.  This is a continuous cycle.

- Security controls encompass physical, procedural, and technical mechanisms to safeguard systems. Assessments identify weaknesses, confirm remediation, prioritize mitigation, provide assurance of effective controls, and support future budgetary planning.

- Personnel conducting assessments can be internal or external. NIST provides a framework (Special Publication 800-53A) for effective assessment plans, outlining objectives, methods, and objects.  An example is analyzing unsuccessful logon attempts.

### Understanding IT Security Audits

- An IT security audit independently assesses an organization's policies, controls, and activities.  It's crucial for ensuring compliance and identifying vulnerabilities.

- Audits can cover organizational management, compliance with laws and guidelines, application usage, and technical infrastructure.

- Effective audit programs aim to provide objective reviews, reasonable assurance of effective controls, and recommendations for improvement.  Auditors should be independent of the systems they audit.  Internal auditors are employed by the organization, while external auditors are independent.

### Compliance and the Differences Between Audits and Assessments

- Internal compliance focuses on following an organization's own policies, while external compliance involves adhering to external regulations and guidelines.  Meeting compliance involves interpreting regulations, identifying gaps, devising and executing plans to close those gaps.

- Compliance is closely linked to risk management and governance.

- Audits differ from assessments in their rigor and process. Audits follow a more structured approach and require auditor independence from the systems being audited.  Assessments can be less formal and consider future expectations.  Successful audits often lead to certification.

### Non-Compliance Consequences

- Non-compliance can result in financial, reputational, and operational consequences.

- Costs associated with security breaches include discovery, notification, lost productivity, opportunity costs, regulatory fines, restitution, and additional security/audit requirements.

## Auditing Standards and Frameworks

### The Importance of Frameworks in Auditing

- A framework provides structure and consistency in complex situations.  In IT, it offers a consistent system of controls for departments to follow and a consistent approach for auditors.

### Using Standards in Compliance Auditing

- Different standards (e.g., COSO, COBIT, ISO/IEC 27000, NIST 800-53, Cybersecurity Framework) have varying attributes like depth, breadth, flexibility, reasoning, prioritization, and industry acceptance.

- Successful auditing requires agreement between the auditor and organization on a specific standard.  Key recommendations include selecting a standard that is easily followed, employing it consistently, and choosing a flexible standard.

### Hierarchy of Standards and Compliance

- A hierarchical structure exists, with regulations at the top (e.g., SOX, HIPAA, GLBA), followed by governance frameworks (COSO, COBIT), control objectives (COBIT), and finally controls (ISO/IEC 27002, NIST 800-53).  Each level has associated personnel responsible for its implementation and oversight.

### COSO Framework

- COSO (Committee of Sponsoring Organizations) provides a structure for examining and applying risk-based processes.

- The COSO ERM framework has eight components across four objectives: strategic, operations, reporting, and compliance.

- The framework identifies eight interrelated parts of an organization's management processes: internal environment, objective setting, event identification, risk assessment, risk response, control activities, information and communication, and monitoring.

### COBIT Framework

- COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology) aligns IT with business requirements by mapping controls to business needs, classifying IT activities, identifying key resources, and defining a framework for control objectives.

- COBIT 5 principles include meeting stakeholder needs (benefits, risk, and resource optimization), covering the enterprise end-to-end (through governance enablers and scope), applying a single integrated framework, enabling a holistic approach, and separating governance from management.

### ISO/IEC Standards and NIST 800-53

- ISO (International Organization for Standardization) provides standards and guidance on information security.  ISO/IEC 27000 series offers guidance on implementing, designing, and auditing information security management systems (ISMS).

- ISO/IEC 27001 specifies requirements for establishing, implementing, maintaining, and improving ISMS.  ISO/IEC 27002 provides a code of practice for information security management.

- NIST 800-53 provides a comprehensive catalog of security controls grouped into 17 families (access control, awareness training, audit and accountability, etc.).

### Cybersecurity Framework

- The Cybersecurity Framework consists of three components: the Framework Core, the Framework Profile, and the Framework Implementation Tiers.  It includes categories across five functions: identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover.

## Planning an IT Infrastructure Audit

### Defining Scope, Objectives, Goals, and Frequency

- When defining the scope, consider controls and processes across the seven domains of IT infrastructure (user, workstation, LAN, LAN-to-WAN, WAN, remote access, system/application).  Relevant resources include data, applications, technology, facilities, and personnel.

### Identifying Critical Requirements

- Critical requirements include implementing security controls (management, operational, and technical) and protecting privacy data.

### Assessing IT Security

- This involves risk management, threat analysis, vulnerability analysis, and defining an acceptable security baseline.

### Obtaining Information and Resources

- This includes defining the existing IT security policy framework, documenting IT infrastructure configurations, and conducting interviews with key IT personnel.

### Mapping to Seven Domains

- The seven domains of a typical IT infrastructure are user, workstation, LAN, LAN-to-WAN, WAN, remote access, and system/application.

### Identifying and Testing Monitoring Requirements

- Continuous monitoring and evaluation of the control environment helps answer questions about IT performance measurement, management effectiveness, linking IT performance to business goals, and the adequacy of confidentiality, integrity, and availability controls.

### Identifying Critical Security Control Points

- SANS Consensus Audit Guidelines (CAG) published in 2009 provide guidance on critical security control points.

### Building a Project Plan

- This involves assigning appropriate personnel and utilizing tools such as electronic work papers, project management software, flowcharting software, open issue tracking software, and an audit department website.

## Conducting and IT Infrastructure Audit

### Identifying Minimum Acceptable Risk and Baseline Definitions

- Determining an appropriate set of baseline controls involves assessing aspects like IT governance, IT policies, risk assessment processes, physical security, authentication mechanisms, malicious code protection, firewalls, configuration management, automated monitoring, and personnel training.

### Organization-Wide Considerations

- Establishing a baseline based on a control framework should align with the organization's risk appetite.  The seven domains of IT infrastructure are composed of people, processes, and technology.  Risk mitigation strategies include accepting, avoiding, sharing, or controlling the risk.

### Gap Analysis

- Gap analysis compares the current state of controls with the desired state, identifying areas needing action.

### Identifying Documented IT Security Policies

- The organizational security policy framework forms the foundation for information security management.  ISO/IEC 27002 provides a dedicated control objective for security policies.

### Layered Audit Approach

- A layered approach is necessary when systems span multiple domains.  A company's financial system, for example, might involve multiple domains and third-party providers.

### Performing a Security Assessment

- Different approaches exist to identify security weaknesses, including network scans, vulnerability scans, and penetration testing.

### Incorporating Security Assessment into the Audit

- ISACA provides auditing standards and guidelines.  Their suggested penetration testing and vulnerability analysis procedures include planning, skills requirements, agreements, scope questions, various types of penetration testing, physical access controls, social engineering testing, wireless and web application testing, and reporting.

### Using Audit Tools

- Computer-assisted audit tools and techniques (CAATTs) increase auditor productivity.  They are used for testing transactions, reviewing procedures, testing controls, conducting vulnerability assessments, and performing penetration testing.

### Automated Audit Reporting

- Automated tools aggregate data, correlate information, and generate reports, simplifying compliance, improving security, and optimizing IT operations.

### Reviewing Configurations and Implementations

- Configuration management directly impacts security and compliance.  It involves a configuration change control board, baseline configuration management, configuration change control, and configuration monitoring and auditing.  Monitoring helps identify unauthorized changes, misconfigurations, vulnerabilities, and unauthorized systems.

### Verifying Security Controls and Countermeasures

- Auditing security controls involves testing using documents, interviews, and observation.  Each control should have an assessment objective, validated using methods like examination, interviews, and testing.  Assessment objects include specification, mechanism, and activity objects.  The effort required to assess controls varies in depth and coverage.

### Identifying Common Problems

- NIST identifies potential challenges such as time and resources, resistance, temporary behavior, immediate response needs, changing technology, and operational impact.

### Validating Security Operations and Accountabilities

- Security operations and administration are responsible for implementing policies to protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability.  Personnel involved in implementation and administration should be authorized.  Safeguards to prevent attacks include security operation policies, assignment of responsibilities, maintenance procedures, segregation of duties, rotation of duties, least privilege, mandatory vacation, screening, and training and awareness.

## Writing the IT Infrastructure Audit Report

### The report should include an executive summary, a summary of findings, IT security assessment results (risks, threats, vulnerabilities), reporting on control implementation, gap analysis, compliance assessment, and compliance recommendations.
