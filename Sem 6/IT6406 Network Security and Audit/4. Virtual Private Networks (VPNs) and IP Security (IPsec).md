# Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) and IP Security (IPsec)

## Introduction to Virtual Private Networks

### Requirement of Remote Access and Private Communication

- Remote access allows organizations to access resources remotely, a common need.

- Site-to-site access connects different branches of an organization (intranet) or different organizations (extranet).  Examples include a bank connecting its head office to branches or a bank giving access to a software development company.

### Private Communication Technologies and Evolution

- Dedicated network links, while providing private communication, are not scalable, expensive, inflexible for remote connectivity, and costly to upgrade.

### What is a Virtual Private Network (VPN)?

- A VPN is a logical communication link that carries private traffic over a public network.

- Access is restricted to defined users.

- Communication is private, not necessarily encrypted (e.g., MPLS).

- Communication is abstracted from the physical substrate, remaining unchanged despite physical layer technology changes.

### Practical VPN Applications

- Ubiquitous access to corporate resources (e.g., working while traveling).

- Accessing private corporate services from remote locations (e.g., a corporate financial system).

- Controlled/private access from many locations by different parties (e.g., a software vendor accessing from their site).

- Long-distance connectivity where leased lines are not feasible (e.g., international employees/clients).

- Infrastructure requirements such as extended LANs (e.g., Oracle DB deployments).

### VPN Implementations

- MPLS (Multi-Protocol Label Switching): Not secure. Uses a labeling mechanism for network isolation. Can be implemented as a full mesh but is limited by service provider networks.

- GRE Tunnels (Generic Routing Encapsulation): Not secure. Uses encapsulation for network isolation. Can forward multicast traffic, unlike other VPN protocols.

- PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol): Secure but considered vulnerable. Introduced by Microsoft, supported by many operating systems. Uses MS-CHAP authentication.  Uses GRE for encapsulation; encryption varies by implementation. Point-to-point connectivity, works only on IP networks.

- L2TP (Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol): Provides PPTP functionality but works on networks other than just IP. Does not provide encryption or authentication; requires IPsec for these services. Uses processes similar to PPTP for encapsulation.

- IPSecurity: Secure and de facto protocol for secure VPN implementations.

- TLS (SSL VPN): Secure.

## IP Security Overview

### Applications of IPsec

- Secure branch office connectivity over the internet.

- Secure remote access over the internet.

- Establishing extranet and intranet connectivity with partners.

- Enhancing electronic commerce security.

### Benefits of IPsec

- When implemented in a firewall or router, it provides strong security for all traffic crossing the perimeter without impacting internal traffic.

- It's resistant to bypass if all external traffic must use IPsec and the firewall is the only entry point.

- It operates below the transport layer (TCP, UDP), making it transparent to applications and end-users.

- It can provide security for individual users.

### Routing Applications

- IPsec ensures that router advertisements, neighbor advertisements, and redirect messages come from authorized routers, preventing forged routing updates.

### IPsec Services

- IPsec provides security services at the IP layer by selecting security protocols, algorithms, and cryptographic keys.

- Two protocols provide security:

	- Authentication Header (AH): An authentication protocol.

	- Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP): A combined encryption/authentication protocol.

- RFC 4301 lists the following services: access control, connectionless integrity, data origin authentication, rejection of replayed packets, confidentiality (encryption), and limited traffic flow confidentiality.

### Transport and Tunnel Modes

- Both AH and ESP support transport and tunnel modes.

- Transport mode is used for end-to-end communication between two hosts. ESP encrypts the IP payload (but not the header); AH authenticates the payload and selected header portions.

- Tunnel mode protects site-to-site/network-to-network communication. ESP encrypts the entire inner IP packet; AH authenticates the entire inner packet and selected portions of the outer header.

## IP Security Policy

### Security Associations

- A security association is a one-way logical connection providing security services. Two are needed for two-way secure exchange.  It's uniquely identified by the Security Parameters Index (SPI), IP destination address, and security protocol identifier.

### IPsec Architecture

- The architecture diagram shows the interaction between the Security Policy Database (SPD), Security Association Database (SAD), IKEv2 (key exchange), and IPsecv3.

### Security Association Database

- Defines parameters associated with each security association (SA).  Parameters include: Security Parameter Index, Sequence Number Counter, Sequence Counter Overflow, Anti-Replay Window, AH Information, ESP Information, Lifetime of the SA, IPsec Protocol Mode, and Path MTU.

### Security Policy Database

- Relates IP traffic to specific SAs (or bypasses IPsec).  Selectors determining an SPD entry include: Remote IP Address, Local IP Address, Next Layer Protocol, Name, and Local and Remote Ports.

### IP Traffic Processing

- Diagrams illustrate the processing of outbound and inbound packets, showing how the SPD and SAD are used to determine whether to process packets using AH/ESP or bypass IPsec.

## Encapsulating Security Payload (ESP)

### ESP provides confidentiality, data origin authentication, connectionless integrity, anti-replay service, and traffic flow confidentiality.

### ESP Format, Encryption and Authentication Algorithms, Padding, and Anti-Replay Service

- These are key components of the ESP protocol.  Diagrams illustrate packet structure before and after applying ESP in transport and tunnel modes.

## Internet Key Exchange

### Key management involves determining and distributing secret keys.

### IPsec supports manual and automated key management.

### The default automated protocol is ISAKMP/Oakley, consisting of the Oakley Key Determination Protocol and the Internet Security Association and Key Management Protocol (ISAKMP).

## Cryptographic Suites

### A cryptographic suite defines a set of cryptographic algorithms, parameters, and key sizes.  The presentation shows examples of VPN-A and VPN-B suites, specifying algorithms used for ESP encryption, ESP integrity, IKE encryption, IKE PRF, IKE integrity, and IKE DH group.
