# Principles of Information Security: Types of Malicious Software

## Types of Malicious Software

### Overview of Malware

- Malware is a program inserted covertly into a system to compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of data, applications, or operating systems.

- Malware can be classified based on how it spreads (propagation) and the actions it performs (payload).

- Understanding these classifications helps in developing effective countermeasures against malware threats.

### Propagation-based Malware Types

- Infected Content: Viruses attach themselves to executable content and spread when that content is accessed.

- Vulnerability Exploit: Worms exploit software vulnerabilities to propagate across systems without user intervention.

- Social Engineering: Trojans and spam emails trick users into executing malicious software by masquerading as legitimate content.

### Payload-based Malware Types

- System Corruption: Malware that damages or disrupts system functionality.

- Attack Agents: Zombies or bots that hijack system resources for malicious purposes.

- Information Theft: Keyloggers, phishing, and spyware that capture sensitive information from users.

- Stealthing: Backdoors and rootkits that hide malware presence and maintain unauthorized access.

## Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs)

### Characteristics of APTs

- APTs are sophisticated, well-resourced attacks targeting specific organizations, often state-sponsored or organized crime.

- They utilize a variety of intrusion technologies and malware over extended periods to achieve their objectives.

- The goals of APTs can include theft of intellectual property, sensitive data, or disruption of critical infrastructure.

### APT Attack Strategies

- APTs differ from traditional attacks by their careful selection of targets and persistent intrusion efforts.

- Attackers may use social engineering, malware, and other tactics to gain initial access and maintain a foothold within the target organization.

- The stealthy nature of APTs makes them particularly challenging to detect and mitigate.

## Viruses and Worms

### Definition and Mechanism

- Viruses are parasitic software fragments that attach to executable content, spreading when that content is executed.

- Worms are standalone programs that replicate themselves across networks, exploiting vulnerabilities to infect new systems.

### Virus Lifecycle

- Dormant Phase: The virus remains inactive until triggered by specific events.

- Propagation Phase: The virus replicates itself and spreads to other programs or system areas.

- Triggering Phase: The virus activates to perform its intended function.

- Execution Phase: The payload is executed, which may involve damage or benign activity.

### Virus Classification

- By Target: Includes boot sector infectors, file infectors, macro viruses, and multipartite viruses.

- By Concealment Strategy: Encrypted, stealth, polymorphic, and metamorphic viruses that evade detection by changing their appearance or behavior.

## System Corruption and Attack Agents

### Understanding Attack Agents

- Attack agents are malware that subvert system resources for the attacker's use, often referred to as bots, zombies, or drones.

- These agents can be part of a botnet, which is a collection of compromised systems that can be controlled collectively.

### Uses of Bots

- Bots can be employed for various malicious activities, including:

	- Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks that overwhelm target systems.

	- Spamming and sniffing traffic to capture sensitive information.

	- Keylogging and spreading new malware to further compromise systems.

### Command and Control (C&C) Servers

- Bots are typically controlled by C&C servers, allowing attackers to issue commands and coordinate attacks.

- Communication with C&C servers can occur periodically, enabling bots to remain hidden while still being able to receive instructions.

## Keyloggers, Phishing, and Spyware

### Keyloggers and Their Function

- Keyloggers capture keystrokes on infected machines, allowing attackers to monitor sensitive information such as login credentials.

- They can bypass encrypted communication channels, making them a significant threat to user privacy.

### Phishing Attacks

- Phishing involves tricking users into providing sensitive information through fake websites or emails that appear legitimate.

- Spear-phishing is a targeted variant where attackers craft personalized messages to increase the likelihood of success.

### Spyware and Its Impact

- Spyware monitors user activity, including browsing history and interactions with websites, potentially redirecting users to malicious sites.

- This type of malware can lead to significant compromises of personal information and privacy.

## Stealthing: Backdoors and Rootkits

### Backdoors in Malware

- A backdoor is a secret entry point into a program that allows unauthorized access without standard security procedures.

- While some backdoors are used legitimately for debugging, malicious backdoors pose significant security risks.

### Rootkits Explained

- A rootkit is a collection of tools designed to maintain covert access to a system while hiding its presence.

- Rootkits can operate at various levels, including user mode and kernel mode, making them difficult to detect and remove.

### Features of Rootkits

- Rootkits can be persistent, activating on system boot, or memory-based, not surviving a reboot.

- They can intercept API calls to modify system behavior and hide their presence from users and security software.

## Countermeasures Against Malware

### Prevention Strategies

- The ideal approach to malware threats is prevention, which involves blocking malware from entering systems.

- While complete prevention is challenging, implementing countermeasures can significantly reduce successful attacks.

### Key Elements of Prevention

- Policy: Establishing guidelines such as regular backups and updates to protect systems.

- Awareness: Educating users about potential threats and safe practices to minimize risk.

- Vulnerability Mitigation: Identifying and addressing weaknesses in systems that could be exploited by malware.

- Threat Mitigation: Implementing security measures to detect and respond to malware threats effectively.
