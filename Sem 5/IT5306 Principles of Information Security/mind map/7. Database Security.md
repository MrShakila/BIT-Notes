# Database Security

## The Need for Database Security

### Importance of Database Security

- A database is a structured collection of data used by applications, containing relationships between data items.

- Database management systems (DBMS) are essential for constructing, maintaining, and querying databases.

- Security tailored to databases is crucial due to the concentration of sensitive information in organizational databases.

### Challenges in Database Security

- Database security has not kept pace with the complexity of modern DBMS, leading to vulnerabilities.

- The complexity of SQL requires a thorough understanding to avoid security flaws.

- Organizations often lack dedicated database security personnel, creating a gap between security needs and capabilities.

### Limitations of Operating System Security

- Operating system security typically controls access at the file level, which is insufficient for database security.

- DBMS allows for more granular access control, enabling restrictions on specific records or fields.

## SQL Injection Attacks

### Overview of SQL Injection

- SQL injection (SQLi) is a prevalent and dangerous security threat that exploits vulnerabilities in the database layer of applications.

- Attackers can manipulate or extract data from web applications through improperly filtered user input.

### Steps in a Typical SQL Injection Attack

- A hacker identifies a vulnerability in a web application and injects malicious SQL code.

- The web server processes the code and sends it to the application server, which forwards it to the database server.

- The database executes the malicious command, potentially exposing sensitive data, such as credit card information.

### Mechanism of SQL Injection

- SQLi attacks often involve prematurely terminating a string and appending a new command.

- For example, if a user inputs malicious SQL code, it can alter the intended SQL query, leading to data manipulation or deletion.

### Countermeasures Against SQL Injection

- Defensive coding practices can significantly reduce SQLi threats, including input validation and pattern matching.

- Parameterized queries separate SQL code from user input, preventing unsanitary input from altering query structure.

- SQL DOM provides a structured way to validate data types and escape potentially harmful input.

### Detection Methods for SQL Injection

- Signature-based detection matches known attack patterns but requires constant updates.

- Anomaly-based detection defines normal behavior and identifies deviations, involving a training phase followed by detection.

- Code analysis techniques use test suites to simulate SQLi attacks and assess system responses.

## Database Access Control

### Access Control Capabilities of DBMS

- Commercial and open-source DBMSs provide various access control mechanisms.

- Centralized administration allows privileged users to manage access rights.

- Ownership-based administration enables table owners to grant or revoke access rights.

### Managing Access Rights with SQL

- SQL commands GRANT and REVOKE manage user access rights.

- The GRANT command can assign access rights to users for specific tables.

- The REVOKE command removes previously granted access rights.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

- RBAC simplifies administration by grouping users based on roles rather than individual access rights.

- This approach improves security and reduces administrative burdens in environments with multiple applications.

### User Classification in Access Control

- Users can be classified as application owners, end users, or administrators, each with different access rights and responsibilities.

- This classification helps in managing permissions effectively and ensuring data security.

## Inference

### Understanding Inference in Database Security

- Inference involves deducing unauthorized information from authorized queries and responses.

- Sensitive combinations of data items can lead to unauthorized disclosures, creating an inference channel.

### Approaches to Mitigating Inference Risks

- Inference detection during database design alters the structure or access controls to prevent inference channels.

- Inference detection at query time denies or modifies queries that could lead to unauthorized data access.

## Database Encryption

### Role of Encryption in Database Security

- Encryption serves as an additional layer of defense against unauthorized access to databases.

- However, key management and inflexibility in searching encrypted data pose significant challenges.

### Types of Encryption

- Encryption can be applied at various levels, including the entire database, record level, attribute level, or individual fields.

- Encrypting individual records as blocks can facilitate better key management and flexibility compared to encrypting the entire database.
