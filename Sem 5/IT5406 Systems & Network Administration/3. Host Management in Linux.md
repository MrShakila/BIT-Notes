# Host Management in Linux

## Overview of Host Management

### Introduction to Host Management

- Host management encompasses various essential topics such as user management, process management, access control, software installation management, logging, storage, and file system management.

- Understanding these components is crucial for effective systems and network administration in a Linux environment.

### Intended Learning Outcomes

- By the end of this lesson, learners will be able to:

	- Install software using the Linux package management system.

	- Implement user management practices in a Linux distribution.

	- Explain various storage technologies.

	- Demonstrate user access control mechanisms.

	- Manage file system access control.

	- Execute process management tasks in a Linux environment.

## Access Control and Rootly Powers

### Standard UNIX Access Control

- Access control decisions are based on the user attempting an operation or their membership in a UNIX group.

- Each object (files, processes) has an owner who has control over it, and the special user account "root" can act as the owner of any object.

- Only the root user can perform sensitive administrative operations, such as creating device files and configuring network interfaces.

### File System Access Control

- The kernel and filesystem are closely linked, controlling devices through files in  /dev .

- Every file has an owner and a group, with permissions set by the owner.

- User Identification Number (UID) and Group Identification Number (GID) are used to track ownership.

### Process Ownership and Management

- The owner of a process can send signals and adjust the process's scheduling priority.

- Processes have multiple identities: real, effective, and saved UID/GID.

- The root account is the administrative user with the highest privileges, capable of performing critical system tasks.

### Management of Root Account

- Direct root login should be disabled to enhance security.

- The  su  command allows users to switch to the root account, while  sudo  provides limited root access with logging capabilities.

- The  /etc/sudoers  file defines who can use  sudo  and what commands they can execute.

## Process Control

### Components of a Process

- Each process has a unique Process ID (PID), Parent PID (PPID), and user/group IDs.

- The process's state can be runnable, sleeping, or stopped, influencing how it interacts with system resources.

### The Life Cycle of a Process

- A new process is created using the  fork  system call, often followed by an  exec  call to run a new program.

- The  init  or  systemd  process is crucial for managing system processes.

- Parent processes must acknowledge the termination of child processes using the  wait  system call.

### Monitoring Processes

- The  ps  command is used to monitor active processes, while  top  provides interactive monitoring.

- Commands like  nice  and  renice  adjust process scheduling priorities.

- The  /proc  filesystem contains information about running processes.

### Runaway Processes

- Runaway processes consume excessive system resources, identifiable through  ps  or  top  outputs.

- Monitoring system load averages helps determine if the system is overloaded.

- Tools like  strace  can trace system calls made by processes to diagnose issues.

## Software Installation and Management

### Managing Packages in Linux

- Linux software is distributed as packages, which include binaries, dependencies, and configuration files.

- Common package formats include RPM (used in Red Hat-based systems) and DEB (used in Debian-based systems).

### High-Level Linux Package Management Systems

- APT (Advanced Package Tool) and YUM (Yellowdog Updater, Modified) are popular package management systems.

- APT commands include  apt-get  for installing and updating packages, while YUM automates dependency resolution.

### Software Localization and Configuration

- Proper organization of software localization is essential for managing multiple devices with different configurations.

- Regular updates and testing of configurations are critical for maintaining system security and functionality.

## User Management

### User Accounts and the /etc/passwd File

- User accounts are identified by User ID (UID), with the  /etc/passwd  file containing user details.

- Each line in  /etc/passwd  includes the login name, encrypted password placeholder, UID, GID, home directory, and login shell.

### The /etc/shadow File

- The  /etc/shadow  file stores encrypted passwords and additional account information, accessible only by the superuser.

- It includes details such as the date of the last password change and password expiration policies.

### Adding and Removing Users

- User accounts can be added manually by editing the  /etc/passwd  and  /etc/group  files or using commands like  useradd .

- Removing users involves cleaning up associated files and processes, ensuring no remnants remain in the system.

### User Login Lockout and PAM

- User accounts can be locked using the  usermod  command, enhancing security.

- Pluggable Authentication Modules (PAM) centralize authentication management, allowing for various methods beyond passwords.

## Logging

### Log Management

- Log management involves collecting logs from various sources and providing structured interfaces for querying and analyzing messages.

- Most log files are located in the  /var/log  directory, while systemd uses the  journalctl  command for log management.

### The System Journal

- The systemd journal collects messages from multiple sources, including the kernel and user applications.

- The journal stores messages in a binary format, allowing for efficient searching and indexing.

### Syslog and Kernel Logging

- Syslog provides a standardized logging protocol, capturing essential information such as timestamps and process names.

- Kernel logs can be accessed using the  dmesg  command, which displays boot-time activities and kernel messages.

### Log Rotation and Management Strategies

- The  logrotate  tool manages log files, ensuring they do not consume excessive disk space.

- Organizations should establish logging policies that define retention periods, types of events to log, and access controls for log data.

## Storage Management

### Storage Hardware and Interfaces

- Understanding different types of storage hardware (HDDs, SSDs) and their interfaces (SATA, PCIe) is crucial for effective storage management.

- Tools like  lsblk  and  parted  help manage and monitor disk partitions and configurations.

### Disk Partitioning and Logical Volume Management

- Proper disk partitioning enhances system performance and organization, with guidelines for separating critical filesystems.

- Logical Volume Management (LVM) allows for flexible disk management, enabling dynamic resizing and snapshots of volumes.

### Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks (RAID)

- RAID improves performance and data redundancy, with various levels (0, 1, 5, 6) offering different trade-offs between speed and data protection.

- Software RAID can be managed using tools like  mdadm , allowing for easy configuration and monitoring.

### Next Generation File Systems

- Newer file systems like ZFS and BTRFS offer advanced features such as snapshots, error detection, and improved performance.

- These file systems provide robust solutions for modern storage needs, including data integrity and efficient management of storage pools.

### Data Backup Strategies

- Organizations must develop comprehensive data backup strategies to protect against data loss due to hardware failure, security breaches, or corruption.

- Backup plans should include timelines for regular backups, validation processes, and access controls to ensure data security and integrity.
