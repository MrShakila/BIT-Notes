# Virtualization and Cloud Computing

## Cloud Computing

### Definition and Overview

- Cloud computing is the practice of leasing computer resources from a pool of shared capacity.

- Users provision resources on demand and pay a metered rate for consumption.

- The transition from private data centers to cloud services has been rapid and transformative.

- Cloud providers create advanced infrastructure designed for energy efficiency and minimal maintenance.

### Factors Influencing Cloud Provider Choice

- Cost is a primary consideration when selecting a cloud provider.

- Past experience with a provider can influence future decisions.

- Compatibility with existing technology is crucial for seamless integration.

- Security and compliance requirements must be met to protect data and adhere to regulations.

- Internal politics may also play a role in the decision-making process.

### Cloud Platform Choices

- There are three main categories of cloud services:

	- Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.

	- Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offers hardware and software tools over the internet, typically for application development.

	- Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) delivers software applications over the internet on a subscription basis.

### Cloud Service Fundamentals

- Most cloud providers use a web-based GUI as the primary interface for users.

- Data centers are maintained globally, organized into regions and availability zones.

- Virtual private servers (VPS) are instances that run on the provider's hardware.

- Networking capabilities allow the creation of virtual networks with custom topologies.

- Cloud providers offer advanced storage systems, identity and authorization features, and automation tools.

- Serverless functions allow code execution without the need for long-lived infrastructure.

### Major Public Cloud Providers

- Prominent public cloud providers include:

	- Amazon Web Services (AWS)

	- Google Cloud Platform (GCP)

	- DigitalOcean (DO)

### Cost Control in Cloud Services

- Pricing for cloud services is based on various factors:

	- Compute resources are billed per hour of use.

	- Internet data transfer is charged per GiB or TiB.

	- Storage costs are calculated per GiB or TiB stored monthly.

- Customers are encouraged to design methods to minimize cloud service costs.

## Virtualization

### Definition and Overview

- Virtualization involves using software or hardware to mediate between virtual machines (VMs) and the underlying hardware.

- Hypervisors manage system resources among guest operating systems, which are isolated from one another.

- Guest operating systems operate independently, enhancing security and resource management.

### Types of Hypervisors

- Hypervisors can be categorized into:

	- Full virtualization, which provides complete abstraction of the hardware.

	- Paravirtualization, which requires guest OS modifications for better performance.

	- Hardware-assisted virtualization, which leverages CPU features to improve efficiency.

	- Paravirtualized drivers, which enhance communication between the guest OS and the hypervisor.

### Type 1 vs. Type 2 Hypervisors

- Type 1 hypervisors run directly on the hardware, providing better performance and efficiency.

- Type 2 hypervisors run on top of a host operating system, making them easier to set up but less efficient.

### Live Migration and Virtual Machine Images

- Live migration allows VMs to move between hypervisors without service interruptions.

- Virtual machine images are templates of configured operating systems that hypervisors can load and execute.

### Containerization

- Containerization is a form of OS-level virtualization that isolates processes without using a hypervisor.

- It relies on kernel features to provide lightweight and efficient resource management.

### Open Source Virtualization Projects

- Leading open-source virtualization projects include:

	- Xen, a paravirtual hypervisor that powers major public clouds.

	- KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine), integrated into the Linux kernel, providing full virtualization.

## Containers

### Background and Core Concepts

- Containers utilize kernel support features such as namespaces, control groups, and capabilities for isolation.

- Docker has emerged as a leading container engine, relying on these kernel features for efficient container management.

### The Open Source Container Engine â€“ Docker

- Docker provides a platform for developing, shipping, and running applications in containers.

- It simplifies the deployment process and enhances application scalability and portability.

### Container Management and Networking

- Container management systems offer features for orchestrating and managing containerized applications.

- Networking capabilities allow containers to communicate with each other and external systems securely.

### Containers in Practice

- Best practices for working with containers include:

	- Using the host's cron daemon for scheduling tasks.

	- Avoiding SSH within containers; instead, use docker exec for interactive sessions.

	- Configuring applications to accept settings from environment variables.

### Security and Logging in Containers

- Security measures include restricting access to the Docker daemon, using TLS, and running processes as unprivileged users.

- Logging practices should be established to monitor container activity and troubleshoot issues effectively.

### Container Clustering and Management

- Container management systems include:

	- Kubernetes, a powerful orchestration tool for managing containerized applications.

	- Docker Swarm, which provides native clustering for Docker containers.

	- AWS EC2 Container Service, which integrates with Amazon's cloud infrastructure for container management.
