# Installing an Operating System

## The Boot Process and Boot Loaders

### Definition and Overview of Boot Process

- The boot process is the sequence of events that occurs when a computer is powered on, leading to the loading of the operating system.

- Boot loaders are essential components that identify and load the operating system kernel into memory.

- The boot process involves several stages, including hardware probing, boot device selection, and kernel loading.

### Steps in the Linux Boot Process

- The process begins with the BIOS or UEFI loading from NVRAM upon power-on.

- The system probes for hardware and selects the boot device, which could be a disk or network.

- The boot loader, such as GRUB, is loaded, which then determines which kernel to boot and initiates the loading of the kernel.

### BIOS vs. UEFI

- BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) is the traditional firmware interface that uses the MBR (Master Boot Record) for booting.

- UEFI (Unified Extensible Firmware Interface) is a modern replacement for BIOS that supports GPT (GUID Partition Table) for more advanced disk partitioning.

- UEFI provides faster boot times and enhanced security features compared to traditional BIOS.

## The Grand Unified Boot Loader (GRUB)

### Overview of GRUB

- GRUB is the default boot loader for most Linux distributions, developed by the GNU project.

- It allows for the configuration of boot options and kernel parameters through a configuration file named grub.cfg.

- The configuration file is typically located in /boot/grub or /boot/grub2, with the main settings found in /etc/default/grub.

### Common GRUB Configuration Options

- GRUB_BACKGROUND: Specifies the background image for the boot menu.

- GRUB_DEFAULT: Sets the default menu entry to boot.

- GRUB_TIMEOUT: Defines the time in seconds to display the boot menu before automatically booting the default entry.

- GRUB_DISABLE_RECOVERY: Prevents the generation of recovery mode entries.

### GRUB Command Line Interface

- GRUB provides a command-line interface for users to edit boot entries at runtime.

- Key commands include:

	- boot: Boots the system from the specified kernel image.

	- linux: Loads a specified Linux kernel.

	- reboot: Reboots the system.

	- search: Searches for devices by file, filesystem label, or UUID.

## System Management Daemons

### Role of Init and System Management

- The init process, which has PID 1, is responsible for starting system processes and managing services.

- It performs essential tasks such as setting the computer name, configuring network interfaces, and starting other daemons.

- Init runs scripts and commands designed for specific contexts, ensuring the system operates smoothly.

### Transition from Init to Systemd

- Systemd has replaced traditional init systems, formalizing and enhancing process management.

- It allows for parallel management of processes, network connections, and logging.

- Systemctl is the command used to investigate and modify systemd configurations.

### Responsibilities of System Management Daemons

- System management daemons handle background tasks, ensuring that necessary services are running.

- They manage system resources, monitor system health, and respond to system events.

- These daemons are essential for maintaining system stability and performance.

## Reboot and Shutdown Procedure

### Commands for Shutting Down Systems

- The halt command is used to shut down the system safely, logging the shutdown and killing non-essential processes.

- The reboot command performs similar functions but restarts the system instead of halting it.

- The shutdown command provides a higher-level interface for scheduling shutdowns and notifying users.

### Importance of Proper Shutdown Procedures

- Proper shutdown procedures prevent data loss and corruption by ensuring all processes are terminated gracefully.

- They help maintain system integrity by flushing cached filesystem blocks to disk before halting the kernel.

- Scheduled shutdowns can be communicated to users, allowing them to save their work.

## Stratagems for a Non-Booting System

### Approaches to Troubleshooting Boot Issues

- When a system fails to boot, administrators can restore it to a known-good state without debugging.

- Alternatively, they can boot the system minimally to access a shell for interactive debugging.

- Another method involves booting from a separate system image to investigate the problematic system's filesystems.

### Common Causes of Boot Failures

- Boot failures can arise from hardware malfunctions, corrupted boot loaders, or misconfigured system files.

- Understanding the boot process helps in diagnosing issues effectively.

- Regular maintenance and updates can prevent many common boot problems.

## Drivers and the Kernel

### Role of the Kernel in System Management

- The kernel abstracts the complexity of hardware interactions, providing a stable API for application programmers.

- It manages hardware devices, processes, memory, and I/O facilities, ensuring efficient operation of the system.

- The kernel also handles housekeeping functions such as startup, shutdown, and multitasking.

### Understanding Device Drivers

- Device drivers act as an interface between the kernel and hardware devices, translating commands for specific hardware.

- They allow the kernel to communicate with various hardware components without needing to understand their specifics.

- Properly functioning drivers are crucial for system stability and performance, as they ensure hardware operates correctly within the system.
