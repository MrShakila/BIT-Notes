# Networking Administration

## Overview of Networking Administration

### Introduction to Key Topics

- This section covers essential topics related to Linux networking, including the domain name system (DNS), single sign-on (SSO), and web hosting.

- Understanding these components is crucial for effective systems and network administration.

- Each topic will be explored to provide a comprehensive understanding of its significance in network management.

## Intended Learning Outcomes

### Goals for Students

- By the end of this lesson, students will be able to:

	- Configure and troubleshoot networks using Linux.

	- Deploy and manage a domain name system.

	- Explain the concept of Single Sign-On and its implementations.

	- Configure and implement web hosting solutions.

## Networking in Linux

### Methods for Configuring Networks

- There are several methods to configure networks in Linux systems:

	- Using command-line tools such as  ip  or  ifconfig .

	- Utilizing NetworkManager, which can operate with a graphical user interface (GUI) or command-line interface (CLI).

	- Editing configuration files directly for network settings.

- After making configuration changes, it is advisable to reboot the system or restart the network service to apply the new settings.

### NetworkManager

- NetworkManager is a tool designed to manage network connections automatically.

- It can run in the background and assess available networks, prioritizing wired connections over wireless ones.

- Users can manage NetworkManager rather than relying solely on system administrators.

### Command-Line Tools

- Key command-line tools for network configuration include:

	-  ifconfig : Used to configure network interfaces.

	-  ip : A more modern tool for network management.

- These tools provide essential functionalities for network setup and troubleshooting.

### Configuration Files

- Different Linux distributions have specific configuration files for network settings.

- For example, in CentOS, network configuration files are located in the  /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/  directory.

- Editing the relevant interface configuration file (e.g.,  ifcfg-enp0s3 ) is necessary for network adjustments.

## Network Troubleshooting

### Basic Troubleshooting Tools

- Several tools are available for troubleshooting network issues in Linux:

	- Ping: Checks if a host is reachable.

	- Traceroute: Identifies the path packets take to reach a destination.

	- Tcpdump: Captures network traffic for analysis.

	- Netstat: Displays network connections and statistics.

### Using Ping

- The  ping  command is a fundamental tool for verifying the availability of a network host.

- It sends ICMP echo requests and listens for replies, helping diagnose connectivity issues.

### Traceroute Functionality

- The  traceroute  command helps trace the route packets take to a specified destination.

- It can reveal the gateways and hops along the path, assisting in identifying where delays or failures occur.

### Tcpdump for Traffic Analysis

-  tcpdump  is a powerful command-line packet analyzer that captures network traffic.

- It allows administrators to inspect packets flowing through network interfaces, aiding in diagnosing complex network issues.

## Network Monitoring

### Importance of Network Monitoring Tools

- Network monitoring tools provide insights into system performance and network health.

- They collect data from various sources to summarize ongoing trends and alert administrators to potential problems.

- Examples of monitoring tools include:

	- SmokePing: Monitors network latency.

	- iPerf: Measures bandwidth and performance.

	- Cacti: Provides graphical representation of network data.

## Firewalls and NAT

### Understanding iptables

-  iptables  is a user-space utility for configuring the Linux kernel firewall.

- It applies ordered chains of rules to network packets, allowing for packet filtering and network address translation (NAT).

- The default table for filtering is the "filter" table, which includes three chains: FORWARD, INPUT, and OUTPUT.

### Configuring iptables

- To use  iptables  effectively, administrators must enable IP forwarding and load necessary kernel modules.

- A typical firewall setup involves a series of  iptables  commands executed in a startup script.

### Implementing NAT

- NAT allows local hosts to access the Internet while hiding their internal IP addresses.

- To enable NAT, administrators must modify kernel variables and use  iptables  commands to route packets appropriately.

## The Domain Name System (DNS)

### DNS Architecture

- DNS is a distributed hierarchical database essential for name resolution on the Internet.

- It consists of various servers, including authoritative and caching servers, which handle queries and responses.

### Configuring DNS in Linux

- Linux systems can be configured to resolve domain names using files such as  resolv.conf  and  nsswitch.conf .

- The  /etc/hosts  file can also be used for local name resolution.

### Understanding DNS Resource Records

- DNS uses resource records (RR) to store information about domain names, including:

	- A records: Map hostnames to IPv4 addresses.

	- AAAA records: Map hostnames to IPv6 addresses.

	- MX records: Define mail exchange servers for a domain.

## Single Sign-On (SSO)

### Core Elements of SSO

- SSO involves a centralized directory store for managing user information and authenticating identities.

- It simplifies user access across multiple applications by allowing a single set of credentials.

### LDAP Service in SSO

- The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) serves as a central repository for user attributes and account information.

- It supports various applications in authenticating users without managing account details directly.

### Implementing Directory Services

- Students are encouraged to implement and deploy directory services, configuring  sssd  and  pam  for user authentication through LDAP.

## Web Hosting

### Understanding HTTP

- HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a client/server protocol used for transferring data on the web.

- It has evolved from plain text in HTTP/1.0 and 1.1 to a binary format in HTTP/2 for improved efficiency.

### Structure of HTTP Transactions

- An HTTP transaction consists of requests and responses, with headers providing metadata about the data being transferred.

- Students should familiarize themselves with tools like  curl  for testing HTTP interactions.

### Web Server Basics

- Web servers play a crucial role in serving content and managing HTTP requests.

- They can handle static content, proxy requests to application servers, and implement features like virtual hosting and TLS connections.

### Load Balancing and Caching

- Load balancers distribute incoming requests across multiple servers to prevent overload and ensure high availability.

- Caching mechanisms store frequently requested data to improve response times and reduce server load.

### Apache and NGINX Configuration

- Apache and NGINX are popular web server software, each with unique configuration requirements for hosting websites.

- Understanding how to configure these servers for virtual hosting, TLS, and load balancing is essential for effective web hosting management.
