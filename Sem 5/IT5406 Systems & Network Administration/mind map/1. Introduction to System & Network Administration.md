# Introduction to System & Network Administration

## Duties of a System Administrator

### Overview of Responsibilities

- System administrators are responsible for controlling access to systems and networks, ensuring that only authorized users can access sensitive information.

- They add and configure hardware components to maintain and enhance system performance.

- Automating tasks is a key duty, allowing for efficiency and consistency in system operations.

- Regular oversight of backups is crucial to prevent data loss and ensure recovery in case of failures.

### Additional Responsibilities

- System administrators monitor system performance and troubleshoot issues to maintain optimal operation.

- They maintain local documentation to provide clear guidelines and records of system configurations and procedures.

- Vigilant security monitoring is essential to protect systems from unauthorized access and potential threats.

- Tuning performance involves adjusting system settings and configurations to improve efficiency and speed.

## Introduction to Linux Systems

### Understanding Linux Distributions

- A Linux distribution consists of the Linux kernel and various packages that provide commands and functionalities for the operating system.

- While all distributions share the same kernel lineage, they differ in format, type, and the number of packages included.

- Distributions vary in focus, support, and popularity, catering to different user needs and environments.

### Popular Linux Distributions

- Some widely used Linux distributions include:

	- Arch

	- CentOS

	- Debian

	- Fedora

	- Ubuntu

- Each distribution has its unique features and target audiences, from general users to enterprise environments.

## Man Pages and Other Online Documentation

### Importance of Man Pages

- Man pages, or manual pages, provide concise documentation for commands, drivers, and library routines in Linux.

- They are typically installed alongside software packages and serve as a primary resource for users to understand command usage and options.

- To access a man page, users can type the command  man <command>  in the terminal.

### Structure of Man Pages

- Man pages are organized into sections, including:

	- User-level commands and applications

	- System calls and kernel error codes

	- Library calls and device drivers

	- Miscellaneous files and documents

- This structured approach allows users to quickly find relevant information based on their needs.

## Ways to Find and Install Software

### Finding Available Packages

- To check if a package is already installed, users can utilize the  which  command to locate binaries in their search path.

- For example, typing  which <application/package name>  will reveal if the application is available on the system.

### Installing New Software

- Software can be installed using package managers like  apt  or  yum , which simplify the process of obtaining and managing software.

- Alternatively, users can build software from source code by downloading it, compiling it, and installing it manually.

- Some applications can also be installed via web scripts that automate the download and installation process.

## Specialization and Adjacent Disciplines

### Overlapping Roles

- System administrators often work alongside other specialists, including:

	- DevOps professionals who integrate development and operations.

	- Site reliability engineers focused on system uptime and reliability.

	- Security operations engineers who ensure system security.

	- Network and database administrators managing specific system components.

### Importance of Collaboration

- Collaboration among these roles is essential for building and maintaining complex networks effectively.

- Each role contributes unique skills and perspectives, enhancing the overall performance and security of the IT infrastructure.

## Ethics and Code of Conduct

### Ethical Responsibilities

- System administrators must uphold professionalism and personal integrity in their work.

- They are responsible for maintaining privacy and adhering to laws and policies related to information technology.

- Effective communication is vital for conveying technical information clearly to diverse audiences.

### Commitment to the Community

- System administrators have a responsibility to the computing community, ensuring that their actions contribute positively to the field.

- They must also consider social and ethical responsibilities, promoting best practices and ethical behavior in technology use.

### Reference for Ethical Guidelines

- The ethical guidelines for system administrators can be found in resources such as the LOPSA Code of Ethics, which outlines the principles and responsibilities expected of IT professionals.
