# Intellectual Property

## 1. Understanding Intellectual Property

### 1.1 Tangible Properties Vs Intangible Properties

- Tangible properties are physical items that can be touched, such as bicycles or buildings. If stolen, the owner loses possession.

- Intangible properties, like trademarks and software, cannot be physically touched. For instance, if a formula for a drug is memorized and used by someone else, the original inventor still retains ownership of the formula.

- The distinction is crucial as it determines the legal protections available under intellectual property rights.

### 1.2 Different Types of Intellectual Property Rights

- Intellectual property rights include various protections for different types of creations, such as copyrights, patents, trademarks, and confidential information.

- Copyright protects the right to copy original works, including software, while patents protect inventions by granting monopolies for a limited time.

- Confidential information includes trade secrets that must be kept confidential to maintain their value, while trademarks identify the source of goods or services.

## 2. Copyrights

### 2.1 The Rights of the Copyright Owner

- Copyright owners have exclusive rights to reproduce, adapt, distribute, and publicly display their works.

- These rights last for 70 years after the author's death, with specific exceptions and special cases that may apply.

- Owners cannot prevent others from using identical material unless they can prove it was copied from their copyrighted work.

### 2.2 What You Can Do to a Copyright Work

- Users can make backup copies of authorized software, decompile programs for error correction, and sell their rights to use a program.

- However, they cannot retain copies after selling their rights, and only one backup copy is allowed.

- The law permits certain actions that do not infringe on copyright, such as fair use for educational purposes.

### 2.3 Databases

- Databases can be protected under copyright if they represent the author's intellectual creation, requiring substantial investment to compile.

- A special intellectual property right known as the database right was introduced in 1997, lasting for 15 years and preventing unauthorized extraction of substantial parts of the database.

- Updates to a database can renew this protection for another 15 years.

### 2.4 Copyright Infringement

- Infringement occurs when someone violates the exclusive rights of the copyright owner, categorized into primary and secondary infringement.

- Primary infringement involves direct violations, while secondary infringement occurs in commercial contexts, such as trading in pirated software.

- Legal remedies for infringement include claims for damages and injunctions to prevent further violations.

## 3. Patents

### 3.1 What Can Be Patented?

- To qualify for a patent, an invention must be new, involve an inventive step, and be capable of industrial application.

- Certain areas are specifically excluded from patentability, such as scientific theories and mathematical methods.

- The patent application process requires detailed specifications and can take several years to complete.

### 3.2 Areas Specifically Excluded

- Abstract ideas, literary works, and methods for performing mental acts cannot be patented.

- However, a machine or process that utilizes these ideas in a novel way may be patentable.

- The patent must be applied for explicitly, unlike copyright, which is automatic upon creation.

### 3.3 Obtaining a Patent

- The process of obtaining a patent involves filing an application with national patent offices, which can be time-consuming and costly.

- An initial application establishes priority, meaning that if another application is filed for a similar invention, the first one takes precedence.

- Inventors must ensure their inventions are novel and not publicly disclosed before applying.

### 3.4 Enforcing a Patent

- Enforcing a patent requires legal action if infringement occurs, which can be expensive and lengthy.

- The patent holder must prove that their invention is new and that the infringer has violated their rights.

- Different countries have varying laws regarding the patentability of software, with some excluding software patents altogether.

## 4. Trademarks

### 4.1 Purpose of Trademarks

- Trademarks serve to distinguish goods or services from different manufacturers, preventing consumer confusion.

- They protect against counterfeit goods and ensure that consumers can identify the source of products.

- Trademark registration provides stronger legal protection and simplifies enforcement against infringement.

### 4.2 How to Protect Software Using Trademarks

- Software companies can use trademarks to protect their products from piracy by prominently displaying their trademarks on software and packaging.

- Unauthorized use of a trademarked name or logo can lead to legal penalties for the infringer.

- Trademarks can also enhance brand recognition and consumer trust in software products.

## 5. Creative Commons Licenses

### 5.1 How to Choose a CC License

- Creative Commons licenses allow creators to define how their works can be used by others, balancing rights and access.

- Key considerations include whether to allow commercial use and whether to permit derivative works.

- The "ShareAlike" clause encourages sharing under the same terms, fostering collaborative development.

### 5.2 Four Rights

- The four main rights under Creative Commons licenses include Attribution (BY), Share-alike (SA), Non-commercial (NC), and No Derivative works (ND).

- Each license type specifies how others can use, share, and modify the original work, ensuring proper credit is given to the creator.

- These licenses help creators maintain control over their works while promoting broader access.

### 5.3 Six Regularly Used Licenses

- Commonly used licenses include CC-BY, CC-BY-SA, CC-BY-ND, CC-BY-NC, CC-BY-NC-SA, and CC-BY-NC-ND.

- Each license has specific conditions regarding commercial use, derivative works, and attribution requirements.

- The CC0 license allows creators to waive all rights, placing their works in the public domain for unrestricted use.

## 6. Fair Use Policy

### 6.1 Understanding Fair Use

- Fair use allows limited use of copyrighted material without permission for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, or research.

- The doctrine promotes freedom of expression while balancing the rights of copyright owners.

- Determining fair use involves analyzing the purpose, nature, amount, and effect of the use on the market for the original work.

### 6.2 Four Factors of Fair Use

- The four factors to consider include:

	- Purpose and character of the use, focusing on whether it is commercial or educational.

	- Nature of the copyrighted work, with factual works more likely to qualify for fair use.

	- Amount and substantiality of the portion used, where smaller portions are more likely to be considered fair.

	- Effect on the market, assessing whether the use harms the original work's market potential.

### 6.3 Implications of Fair Use

- Fair use is not a blanket exemption; each case is evaluated on its specific circumstances.

- Courts may rule differently based on the context and details of the use, leading to varying outcomes in fair use claims.

- Understanding fair use is essential for creators and users of copyrighted material to navigate legal boundaries effectively.
