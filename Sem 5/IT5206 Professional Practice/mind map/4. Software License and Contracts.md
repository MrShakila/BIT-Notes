# Software License and Contracts

## Introduction to Contracts

### Definition of a Contract

- A contract is an agreement between two or more parties that can be enforced in a court of law.

- Parties involved may be legal persons (companies) or natural persons (individuals).

- Contracts do not require a specific form; in England and Wales, they need not be written.

### Essential Elements of a Contract

- All parties must intend to create a contract.

- Parties must be competent, meaning they should be of legal age and mentally capable.

- There must be consideration, where each party provides something of value.

### Contract Law Overview

- Contract law is primarily based on common law.

- Existing laws can handle contracts for computers, software, and related services.

- New rules are needed for e-commerce, including electronic signatures and jurisdiction issues.

## License Agreements

### Overview of License Agreements

- Typically, customers do not "buy" software but acquire a license to use it under specific conditions.

- Two main types of licenses exist: retail and corporate.

### Retail Software Agreements

- Aimed at the mass market, sold for a one-off fee.

- Large organizations can negotiate bulk licenses at a discount.

- Licenses are usually granted in perpetuity without provisions for updates or assistance.

### Corporate Software Agreements

- Targeted at large organizations with specialized needs.

- Involves substantial upfront fees and annual maintenance fees.

- Fees may depend on usage, such as the number of employees or simultaneous users.

## Outsourcing Contracts

### Characteristics of IT Outsourcing Contracts

- Typically complicated and tailored to individual circumstances.

- Key points include performance monitoring, asset transfer, and audit rights.

### Key Considerations in Outsourcing

- Contingency planning and disaster recovery are crucial.

- Ownership of intellectual property rights developed during the contract must be clearly defined.

- Duration of the agreement and termination provisions should be established.

## Contracts for Custom Built Software

### Structure of the Contract

- A contract usually includes an introductory section, standard terms and conditions, and appendices.

- The introductory section specifies the parties involved and includes definitions of terms.

### Deliverables and Ownership Rights

- Contracts must clearly state what is to be produced and delivered, including source code and documentation.

- Ownership of rights, including intellectual property rights, must be explicitly stated.

### Payment Terms and Penalties

- Payment terms typically include an initial payment followed by stage payments based on project milestones.

- Penalty clauses may be included to address delays caused by the supplier.

## Consultancy and Contract Hire

### Overview of Consultancy Contracts

- Consultancy contracts are simpler than fixed-price contracts and involve confidentiality, terms of reference, liability, and control over reports.

- Payment is usually based on fixed rates for services provided.

### Time and Materials Contracts

- These contracts allow for payment based on actual costs incurred, with labor charged similarly to contract hire.

- They may include maximum payment limits for project reviews.

## Liability for Defective Software

### Understanding Liability

- Suppliers often limit liability for defects in software, typically to the purchase price or a fixed maximum.

- Clauses that attempt to limit liability for personal injury or death are not enforceable.

### Sale of Goods Act Implications

- The Sale of Goods Act requires goods to be fit for their intended purpose, but its applicability to software remains unclear.

- Retail software sold under shrink-wrapped licenses may fall under this act, but online downloads complicate the issue.

## Health and Safety Considerations

### Health and Safety at Work Act

- Employers must ensure the health, safety, and welfare of employees, which includes software-controlled environments.

- Software engineers must be aware of their responsibilities under this act.

### Safety in Software Development

- Organizations developing safety-critical software must employ qualified staff familiar with appropriate development techniques.

- Breaches of health and safety regulations can lead to serious legal consequences.
