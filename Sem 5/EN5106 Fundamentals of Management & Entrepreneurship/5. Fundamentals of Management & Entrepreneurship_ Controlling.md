### Functions of Control

## The Process of Management Control

### Overview of Management Control

- Management control is a continuous process that involves establishing standards, measuring performance, and taking corrective actions to ensure organizational goals are met.

### Feedback Mechanism

- The control process includes feedback loops that allow for adjustments in standards and performance.

- If performance is adequate, no action may be needed; if inadequate, corrective measures are taken.

## Different Types of Organizational Controls

### Input Controls (Feed-forward Controls)

- Input controls focus on active anticipation and prevention of problems before they occur.

- They involve planning and preparing to ensure that organizational plans succeed.

### Process Controls (Concurrent Controls)

- Process controls monitor and adjust ongoing activities and processes to ensure compliance with established standards.

- This type of control is crucial for maintaining quality and efficiency during operations.

### Output Controls (Feedback Controls)

- Output controls involve checking completed activities and learning from past mistakes.

- They allow managers to use historical performance data to align future performance with planned objectives.
