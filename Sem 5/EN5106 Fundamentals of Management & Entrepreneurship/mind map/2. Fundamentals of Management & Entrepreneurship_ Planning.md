# Fundamentals of Management & Entrepreneurship: Planning

## Overview of Planning

### Definition and Importance of Planning

- Planning involves determining the organization’s goals and defining the means for achieving them.

- A goal is a desired future state that the organization attempts to realize, while a plan serves as a blueprint for goal achievement.

- Plans specify necessary resource allocations, schedules, tasks, and other actions required to reach the goals.

### Levels of Plans

- Strategic Goals/Plans: These are broad statements describing where the organization wants to be in the future, focusing on the organization as a whole.

- Tactical Goals/Plans: These pertain to major divisions and departments, detailing what subunits must do to achieve overall goals.

- Operational Goals/Plans: These are precise and measurable results expected from departments, work groups, and individuals.

## The Organizational Planning Process

### Steps in Developing the Plan

- Define Mission: The organization’s reason for existence, describing its values and aspirations.

- Set Goals: Establishing strategic goals that guide the organization’s direction.

- Translate the Plan: Defining tactical plans and developing strategy maps to visualize key drivers of success.

- Plan Operations: Specifying action steps toward achieving operational goals and supporting tactical plans.

- Execute the Plan: Implementing management by objectives (MBO) and utilizing single-use and standing plans.

### Mission Statement

- A mission statement articulates the organization’s purpose and serves as the foundation for all subsequent goals and plans.

- Example: Unilever’s mission is to add vitality to life by meeting everyday needs for nutrition, hygiene, and personal care.

### Importance of Goal Setting

## Translating the Plan

### Tactical Plans

- Tactical plans are designed to help execute major strategic plans and accomplish specific parts of the company’s strategy.

- They bridge the gap between strategic goals and operational actions.

### Strategy Map
